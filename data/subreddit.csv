Why does TWD MTG cards logo features a shooting star?,"If you look at the new MTG TWD cards the logo looks like a shooting star (satellite?) which is kinda weird. WotC logos tend to feature distinctive images that represent artifacts of the universe they're building the set in, like a [heart](https://cdn1.dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/03142601/MTG-My-Little-Pony-Princess-Twilight-Sparkle-and-Rarity-cards.jpg) for the MLP edition or the [eye](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41h8GuAG3xL._AC_.jpg) for the Godzilla set.

So why not use an undead head or go straight for the TWD logo? It seems that they know something we don't. For instance, could the series end with a meteor shower, with the satellite crash being a hit of what's coming? Or did the virus was brought on the Earth along with some cosmic garbage? It just makes no sense to put a shooting star logo on the TWD cards.",1,"Why does TWD MTG cards logo features a shooting star?

Walkers and their many names,"It‚Äôs interesting that everyone has different names for the walkers.

"I love the show, not like I used to but I still do. here are some things I dont like that much in the recent seasons. Mainly s7 and s8 (dont hate me I still fucking love the show)","- Goofy and comic booky stuff - I think the show had a more realistic and natural tone in the earlier seasons. For example I really didnt like Shiva and how she was fighting alongside alexandria in 7x16 (is that even possible with a tiger to know who to kill?). The idea of the kingdom is also not fitting with the feel of rest of the show
- CGI and budget in season 7 and 8 was awful, felt kinda cheap, for example the junkyard and deers
- the junkyard community was awful and didnt feel like TWD
-the story and the war in season 8 were handled really poorly
- character inconsistencies (negan telling the dude that he would never kill kids but he almost killed Carl with Lucille in 7x16 and more)
-lack of ""A"" characters like Rick, Glenn, Carl, Abraham, etc.
-character deaths are not as impactful anymore

The story in s9 and s10 is really great though and I like those. Only the princess is kinda weird haha

What is the approximate timeline of comic to show?,"I know the show is a pretty loose adaptation of the comics, especially as it goes further along. I'm alright with that, I think when you move a story to a new format you need to make changes. So understanding that the story isn't a 1:1 adaptation, and maybe it even kinda ditches the comics entirely later on (I don't know), what would you guys say is the approximate timeline of which volumes in the comics are in which seasons of the show?

I just started reading the comics, and would love to start the show, but I don't want to watch past where I am in the book or get some sudden foreshadow in the show that spoils something in the book, or anything like that. I'm far enough by now that I assume I'll at least be fine for a few episodes, but probably not for a full season.

I've tried to look around on the internet, but all I can find is examples of differences.

Shall I get back on board the TWD hype?,"I used to be a TWD die hard. It was all I could think about but after a long while I started to really dislike what was being out out.

The last time I truly loved the show was Season 3, I kept with it till season 8. It had great moments peppered through but it mostly bored me and hated how characters and story were treated. I watched s9 after hearing it got a lot better once Rick left but to be honest it never grabbed me.

I watched the first 3 season of Fear and kinda like s3 but just haven't taken the time to get back on it.

I finished the comic a few months back but it literally took me a year to read the last 7 or 8 issues. I really didn't like the ending to the main story. I read The Alien. I haven't read any of the Negan stuff.

I've only ever read the first book which was about the governor but I was never fussed on getting into the novels.

Now, the telltale game is something I really will get back into because I loved it. I played the first 2 seasons, 400 days, Michonne episode 1 and the first 2 episodes of new frontier.
I plan on replaying all theses and do the whole series.

In this alternate universe, Lizzie and Mika obviously don‚Äôt die, but Lizzie still attacks Mika, but only injures her enough to nearly kill her, but she make sit through the ordeal. 

Lizzie overhears Carol and Tyreese talking about what to do about her and decides to run away, so when Carol goes to get and *talk* with her, she‚Äôs already gone. Carol is torn between wanting to find her, or leave her be. She asks Mika what she wants to do and she tells Carol to *not* look for and Lizzie and says 

- *‚ÄùShe just wants to be with her friends, we should just leave her alone and let be with them‚Äù*

Eventually, Mika recovers enough to be able to walk and leave the grove with Carol, Tyreese, and Judith. She encounters terminus, Gareth, Grady memorial, and the deaths of Bob, Beth, and Tyreese and slowly becomes hardened and scarred from all that she has witnessed and endured with the group.

Then when the group reaches Alexandria, she reverts back to the girl we first met at the prison. Sweet, innocent, and not having a mean bone in her body. Until Carol or Carl *(cuz I like to think she‚Äôd form a bind with since they were the only kids in the group)* confront her on her pretending the like what happened before they came never happened and she tells them

- *‚ÄùOf course I‚Äôm pretending, just like I did back at the prison. It was so much simpler back then. There was no Terminus, no bad people, our friends were still alive, and **my own sister didn‚Äôt try to kill me!!**‚Äù*

This outburst causes her to break down and cry. 

Then when Morgan joins the group in Alexandria, she forms a bind with him over his ‚Äúall life is precious‚Äù philosophy and wants him to teach her how to use a staff, which he does. She goes through a similar plot as Morgan with the conflicting beliefs of whether to kill or not kill after the wolves attacks and the assault on the Savior outpost. 

When Carol leaves Alexandria, she goes with Morgan and Rick to find her, then instead of going back with Rick to the community, she chooses to stay with Morgan and help him find Carol and tells them

- *‚ÄùI have to find her, she‚Äôs the closest thing I‚Äôve had to a mom since before the world went to shit.‚Äù*

Then when she and Morgan finally find Carol and makes her first kill and she and Morgan protect her from a vengeful Savior. Eventually they arrive at the Kingdom and she‚Äôs enjoying her life there. She forms a bind with Henry and Ezekiel, but doesn‚Äôt open up to them about who she was before the apocalypse and or what she went through before meeting them. 

After witnessing the death of Benjamin and Morgan killing Richard, Mika‚Äôs crisis of faith and morality comes to a close when she accepts the world what it is and finally understands that sometimes, killing is necessary. She sneakily followed Ezekiel‚Äôs regiment to Alexandria and helps defend when it‚Äôs under siege by the Saviors and The Scavengers. She takes part in the fight during the war with the Saviors. 

Then we come to now, the war with whisperers, Mika is all grown up now and is pretty much comparable to Carol, but much younger. It‚Äôs during the war, where Lizzie finally returns, but as a whisperer. She fully embraces the whisperer mentality and forms a deep bond with Alpha, in a way, she‚Äôs everything that Alpha wished Lydia was. 

She eventually ditches her names and adopts the title of *‚ÄùDelta‚Äù*, given to her by Alpha herself. She is undoubtedly loyal to Alpha and the whisperers and even compliments Mary/Gamma on what she did, saying.

- *‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little jealous honestly, You did something that I never got to.‚Äù*

Eventually, when she and Mika finally reunite. Mika at first tries to appeal to her as her sister, but unfortunately Lizzie/Delta is too far gone and Lizzie/Delta says to her. 

- *‚ÄúAll you are to me, is unfinished business, and I plan on finally finishing it today.‚Äù*

The fight between them is intense and it all ends when Mika manages to get the upper hand and stabs Lizzie in the stomach, just like what Lizzie did to her back at the grove. Mika‚Äôs parting words to Lizzie before leaving her body in the woods. 

- *‚ÄúI love you, Lizzie.‚Äù*

Showing that despite everything Lizzie did to her, physically and mentally, that she was still her sister and that she‚Äôd always love her. 

And as Lizzie takes her final breathe, she looks up at a tree and sees flowers growing from it, and smiles as she looks at them, remembering the sense of calmness the flowers use to give her.

So what did you think, I‚Äôm thinking of making this into an actually fanfic, but that do y‚Äôall think?",1,"A Plot Idea for Lizzie and Mika if They Were in Season 10 **Fair Warning, this is gonna be a very long post:**

I want to read the comics,"I've been a fan of the show since season 2, I was so upset when rick left that I actually just stop watching the show back then. The thing is, now i've decided to watch the show all over again, i'm now in the episode 11 of the season 9 and I got to say, it's not the same without rick...
So if I wanted more Rick I thought that I could maybe read the comics, but there's a problem:
I am a DC and marvel reader and those universes are a chaos, so i would like to know if TWD comics aren't like that, do they have a clear lineal story progression that I can read from start to finish (if they ended already). I hope it's like that, and if it's like that, how can I buy them all? Are there any big compilations like INJUSTICE? Because buying all 196 comics is going to be a nightmare.

Can a show with just Carol and Daryl work?,Just curious to see what people think. I‚Äôm really hoping for another ensemble show myself even if it makes this spinoff identical to TWD. I just don‚Äôt trust that a show centered completely around Carol and Daryl and nobody else will keep my interest for long (which is sad for me to say because Carol‚Äôs always been my diehard favorite character). I keep visualizing Ride With Norman Reedus with zombies where it‚Äôs an episodic kinda show and D&amp;C meander around New Mexico encountering one-off characters and bizarro Z Nation-esque situations every episode. For the short term that does sound kinda fun (as a half hour thing at least) but for the long-term idk. I can see myself getting very quickly bored with it.

Why do the writers avoid putting Michonne in danger or making her look bad?,"With characters like Rick, Daryl, Carol, and others; you often see them in difficult situations. Rick gets beat-down from Governor, emasculated by Negan; and his role as leader gets challenged by others. Daryl gets captured by the Saviors and tortured. Carol gets shot and saved by Morgan etc etc

But with Michonne, there are hardly any instances where she is in a tough spot. The writers never make Michonne lose, they never have other characters challenge her or question her, you never see Michonne in a situation where you believe that something bad will happen to her. She is basically this sort of superwoman character on the show. It's as if they go out of their way to protect her.

The only time I think they went in this direction was the fight with the Governor, where Michonne took some shots (but she ultimately won, stabbing Governor's eye).",1,"Why do the writers avoid putting Michonne in danger or making her look bad?

TWD 9x15,I'm up to episode 15 of season 9 in The Walking Dead and i'm trying to mentally prepare myself because I know what happens with the heads on the pikes. What makes it even worse is that Tara is one of my favorite characters in the whole show and it's going to absolutely traumatize me to see her severed head on a stick. I am not looking forward to it. Can someone please tell me in the comments if it's really really bad so I'm prepared?

I just finished the All Out War arc in the comics,"Okay so please don't spoil anything for over 125.
What was up with Maggie beating on Rick when Negan kills Glenn? Like wtf did she expect to try and kill Negan and not only then still get Negan killed but get all of them killed? And by Maggie's logic when saying Rick should have just killed Glenn himself then she should have just killed Sophia herself because Sophia would have died if Rick tried anything. In my opinion Glenn was done way better in  the show. Also what's up with Sophia hating Carl? She starts going on about having new friends and she hates him (I forgot what issue) even tho Carl already told Sophia he wasn't actually going to shoot Maggie. I also feel the show did Rick slitting Negans throat better, I just didn't buy the whole Negan actually agreeing on what Rick was saying, I mean a man who's bashed in heads and all that crazy stuff wouldn't just agree to stuff like that that easily. I loved comic Nicholas alot more then show Nicholas. Finding out the comic didn't have the whole Eugene sabotaging the bullets part and Rick fighting Negan and the Saviors in the field was disappointing. Finally I felt that the whole telling Negan how things can be with working together would have worked more better for show Negan as show Negan has some humanity in the All Out War arc.",1,"I just finished the All Out War arc in the comics Okay so please don't spoil anything for over 125.

"Might not compare to some of the other art here, but thought I'd post my sketch of Rick",,1,
Some things I noticed throughout the show's lifespan,"* Season 1 to 3 is pretty much the beginning and ending of its own arc.
   * Rick leaving his house to the survivor camp, searching for his family, finding that family, losing his wife, returning to his house, and finally burying the dead at the end.
   * Rick finding the bag of guns, retrieving them from antagonists who later turn out to be good people, and the guns circulating all the way into The Governor's hands by the end.
   * Rick and Andrea's trust and friendship beginning and falling apart and Rick saying farewell to her.
   * Carl going from an innocent boy to gunning a Woodbury soldier down in Season 3.
* Lori should have lived until the end of Season 3. The entire ""prison attack"" was botched and I blame Mazzara. Season 4 had a better attack, but as soon as Hershel died all of the major losses were on The Governor's side. 
* ""Clear"" is still the best episode of the series by far, with ""Still,"" ""Days Gone By,"" and ""The Day Will Come When You Won't Be"" as close seconds.
* Negan's writing between Seasons 7 and 8 is vastly different. In Season 7 he's definitely the villain, and in Season 8 they try to pile on the ""anti hero"" parts of his character. The comic did a better job of this. I can't tell if it's because I knew what would happen by that point or not, but I felt like Negan was a more ambiguous character in the comic, wherein the show we know Jeffrey Dean Morgan is too awesome of an actor to play a guy who is an outright monster (except Comedian maybe)
* Rick and Morgan's relationship was somehow improved and ruined - I really like how Morgan developed into a more peaceful character, but somehow after he went back to being ""Crazy Morgan"" again they tied him to Carol and Jesus instead of Rick, and they only gave him and Rick a single episode together - where their shared traumas were blatantly apparent, and finally Rick had suffered exactly what Morgan predicted would happen - the loss of a wife and a son.
* Daryl... RUINED Rick's quote from the comic, ""WE **ARE** THE WALKING DEAD."" I wish someone would edit Norman Reedus's line there. It would've been the most powerful episode of the season if not for that.",1,"Some things I noticed throughout the show's lifespan * Season 1 to 3 is pretty much the beginning and ending of its own arc.

Should they have brought Morgan's character back in the show?,"I like Morgan, I like the actor who portrayed him. I like the whole monastic, non-violence philosophy.

But at the same time, I feel the writers shouldn't have brought his character back after the first season. A more compelling angle involved leaving his and Duane's fate unknown. That way, the viewer would always wonder, ""Whatever happened to that sweet man and kid who saved Rick's life, who gave him food, in the first episode? ... Did he and the boy make it? Did they ever get the message on the radio that Rick left? Did they both turn into walkers? Did other humans kill them? etc etc"" 

Not having an answer to those questions  added to the horror, hopeless, depressing atmosphere of the opening seasons.  It lingered like an undercurrent in the setting. Morgan's fairytale-esque return killed that feeling.

Additionally, to bring Morgan back, the writers had to jump through hurdles or stretch realism:

1). Rick, Michonne, and Carl just happen to run into Morgan when they make a run in town. Too much coincidence.

2). Morgan's recovery from insanity, where he meets that man who teaches him nonviolence, seemed unrealistic in that apocalypse setting.

3).  Morgan somehow makes it from Atlanta to Alexandria, on foot, and manages to find Rick &amp; the others. The show rendered how difficult that trip was for the group, who had a car; yet somehow Morgan made that journey by himself. Too unrealistic.",1,"Should they have brought Morgan's character back in the show? I like Morgan, I like the actor who portrayed him. I like the whole monastic, non-violence philosophy.

Question regarding Season 10 that i can not find the answer to anywhere else.,"Hello first id like to start off by saying i first began watching the Show back when it first premiered and stuck with it up until season 7 premier and after that i kind of got bored with the show so i stopped there and did not know what followed. 

Years later this year actually while being stuck at home due to quarantine i decided to rewatch the entire show from the first episode all the way until i got caught up and again ingot fatigued at the season 7 premiere so i took like a week or 2 off but then got back into the show again and watched it every day until i  got caught up. 

While im doing my marathon i hear the news of the show now finally coming to an end and all these spin offs are being done and then the Grimes trilogy got reduced to a single movie and such and then season 10 got extended by 6 more episodes. 

So my question is this. Are the 6 episodes that have been added to TWD season 10 going to continue the whisperer arc or will that conclude in episode 16 that airs on October 4th? Are the episodes basically just filler episodes now since the whisperer arc will be wrapped up by 16? Or will the last 6 episodes kind of act like a prelude to the final act the final season that i heard is also now 24 more episodes. When will the last 6 air is that October or is the show just coming back for 1 last episode which is 16 and the remaining 6 will begin next February? 

TL:DR
I just got back into this series and after i hit a bump in the road i got back into it and have been enjoying it ever since and can not wait to see how the story wraps up and cant wait to see TWD Beyond, or find out what happened to Rick and everything else. Im just wondering what the last 6 episodes of season 10 are going to be like are they continuing the whisperer arc or will that conclude in episode 16? Are the last 6 basically just filler episodes or are they going to act like a prelude to the final act, the final season. 

Also what is up with the drawing on ricks phone that Michonne found in the boat that had a drawing of her and of Judith. Why did it show Judith the way she looks today if it was supposedly drawn by rick and the last time he saw Judith was 6 years prior so theres no way he would of known what she would look like. Are the people hes with basically holding him hostage and they been spying on the old group and possibly took a picture of present day Judith and gave it to Rick? And thats how he knew what she looked like to be able to draw her? I really cant wait to see what happens with him cus i truly do not believe Rick would not find a way to get back to Everyone in the 6 years.",1,"Question regarding Season 10 that i can not find the answer to anywhere else.

Hypothetical question,"So TWD is coming to end with s11. Just thought of this.

Is Fear worth watching?,"So I'm always a good ten years behind on all good TV shows so I'm currently just starting S6 of The Walking Dead on my first watch through. I've seen mixed comments on this sub-reddit about Fear The Walking Dead and wanted to know if it was any good without looking it up and having too much spoiled which has inevitably happened with TWD. So if anyone could give me an idea of what it's about and how they'd rate it without any FTWD or post-S6 TWD spoilers that would be appreciated!!

How were these post-All out War storylines adapted in the show once they killed...,"[](/c ""Carl"")?

I stopped watching in season 8 after he was killed. How were these storylines adapted?

* Carl moving to the Hilltop with Rick.
* Carl saving Sophia from the other kids.
* Earl Sutton teaching him blacksmithing.
* Lydia licking Carl's eye socket.
* Pretty much everything to do with Lydia.
* The parents of the bullies threatening Maggie with Gregory.
* Carl helping defend the Hilltop from the Whisperer's fire attack.
* Andrea's death. (I don't know if the show is this far yet)

I tried looking on the wiki but I think I left with more questions than answers.

Season 10's lack of deaths.,"I believe this season has had the lowest big character deaths. So far only Siddiq and Alpha have died. And Gamma, I guess. 

I wonder if this has to do with Michonne and Maggie; two huge characters who either were absent, or made their exit this season. And due to this, they limited the deaths to soften the blow of missing these two important characters. 

The reason this bothers me is because I figured the Whisperers would be the deadliest adversary our Survivors have faced, and yet, barely anyone has died. At least there's still 10x16.",1,"Season 10's lack of deaths. I believe this season has had the lowest big character deaths. So far only Siddiq and Alpha have died. And Gamma, I guess.

What if Dave Erickson was the showrunner on Walking Dead?,"I am interested in how many of you would think a Dave Erickson Walking Dead would have been like?

A few scenarios of when he would become show runner.   


Scenario 1- He is hired to Walking Dead instead of Fear and takes over as show runner during Season 5 ( right around the time Fear starts just a hair earlier since he would not have to take time to develop Walking Dead like Fear)

Season 10 finale hype,"I just wanna make this post to calm you guys down. Perhaps it‚Äôs best if you don‚Äôt get hyped for the finale.

Based on all the reviews I watched and read... I‚Äôm thoroughly disappointed. It does seem to have a few action scenes but they are barely long enough. Most of the episode seems to consist of heartfelt character moments. 

I think Forbes stated that none of the action scenes are as thrilling or equivalent to Daryl vs Beta in s9. That fight scene with Daryl and Beta was a masterpiece and is without a doubt: the best fight scene in the show. But you‚Äôd expect a fight scene to be more thrilling or at least equivalent to the Daryl vs Beta fight in the s10 finale... but most reviews don‚Äôt seem to emphasize the energy within the action scenes.


This is truly disappointing and I hope all these reviews are wrong... but it likely won‚Äôt be if multiple reviews reveal the same results. Episodes such as Walk with us, Morning Star and Stalker set up this finale to be a brutal bloodbath but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get that... Why wouldn‚Äôt the writers choose to include more action and less talk. We‚Äôve had plenty of talking in 10A and 10x15. 

I‚Äôm gonna watch it with low expectations. I just hope and pray that I will be satisfied.

I‚Äôm not making a hate post.... I love the walking dead. Most definitely my favorite show of all time (yes... I watched Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Wire, etc, but seasons 1-7 and 9-10 of the walking dead has been the best tv I‚Äôve ever seen in my life and I tend to enjoy them more compared to other tv shows as a whole) I just don‚Äôt want to be dissatisfied with the actual product and hope the season 10 finale lives up or exceeds the level of hype it created.

And I hope you guys don‚Äôt feel disappointed due to the hype.

Episodes such as Walk with us, Morning Star and Stalker set up this finale to be a brutal bloodbath but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get that... Why wouldn‚Äôt the writers choose to include more action and less talk. We‚Äôve had plenty of talking in 10A and 10x15. 

I‚Äôm gonna watch it with low expectations. I just hope and pray that I will be satisfied.

I‚Äôm not making a hate post.... I love the walking dead. Most definitely my favorite show of all time (yes... I watched Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Wire, etc, but seasons 1-7 and 9-10 of the walking dead has been the best tv I‚Äôve ever seen in my life and I tend to enjoy them more compared to other tv shows as a whole) I just don‚Äôt want to be dissatisfied with the actual product and hope the season 10 finale lives up or exceeds the level of hype it created.

And I hope you guys don‚Äôt feel disappointed due to the hype. 

Norman Reedus said that it‚Äôs going to be a ‚ÄòGame of thrones‚Äô type battle. And I would be devastated if we don‚Äôt get that."

No Sanctuary is the most overrated episode of the show,"I have no idea why this episode gets so much praise and I know people are gonna downvote me to the very core, but let me explain how this show had you brainwashed for an episode.

I will admit that Carol was a good character in the episode, in fact she was the only good character.

When the cannibals take Rick and three others to the interrogation room, four other prisoners are leaning over some sort of trough which they make Rick and company do as well. One of them being an obscure character that NO ONE will remember or slightly care about. He appeared briefly in ‚ÄúIndifference‚Äù and was onscreen for about two minutes. They sort of did something like this in the previous episode ‚ÄúA‚Äù when some random person is surrounded by walkers. Why was this important? No idea.

Anyway, the cannibals slit open the four random prisoners‚Äô throats while they leave Rick and three others alive. They decide NOT to kill Rick and his group! While these stupid cannibals are taking their sweet time for plot convenience, Carol blows up a gas tank JUST as the leader was about to kill one of Rick‚Äôs men! OH WOW, WHAT PERFECT TIMING!!

And that‚Äôs one of the problems with this episode; the events that happen have to be very precise with their timing thanks to plot armour. Rick and his group somehow manage to escape (I forgot how because it was pretty forgettable) and Carol eventually saves everyone.

Also, these cannibals barely have any motive. We‚Äôre shown at the beginning and end of the stupid episode that these people were being held the same way as Rick‚Äôs group. This serves no point, kinda like their motive.

Meanwhile, Tyreese is taking care of the baby, while this asshole Martin keeps saying stupid shit. He remembers going to church? We get it, show. You‚Äôre religious to hell, can you just stop now? No, they never did and they will. I think I know the genre of the show now. It‚Äôs not horror like in the early seasons and it‚Äôs not action like in Seasons 5-8 (the bad seasons), it‚Äôs Christian!

At the end of the episode (the actual end cause this episode literally has three endings), Rick smears the sign and it now reads the title of the episode. No shit, Sherlock. Doing something like that is the equivalent of; saying ‚Äúcareful not to fall‚Äù to someone who‚Äôs dangling over an edge about to fall. There‚Äôs probably hundreds of those signs! Editing the sign like that isn‚Äôt gonna do anything. People will find the smouldering ruins so they already know there‚Äôs no damn sanctuary!!

Hopefully this will clear your thoughts. How this episode had you all brainwashed I will never know.

"Q&amp;A Episode 10.16 ""A Certain Doom"" - We Are TWD Fans","Many of you might know that TSDF has shut down. However, I'm still deep in the spoiler game.  This Q&amp;A is from the same reliable source that we had over at TSDF. We just have a new site now known as ""We are TWD Fans"" (WATF).  With that said, here's some spoiler treats for the season 10 finale. Enjoy!   


**1. What‚Äôs the plan to eliminate the herd? Are they successful?**  


It's to lead them over the edge of a cliff with a carriage carrying a tape deck, playing Burning Down the House by Talking Heads. Yes to the second part, just not with the wagon because it's ambushed and destroyed by the Whisperers. It's Lydia and Carol leading them to and over the edge of the cliff instead.  


**2. How do Daryl and Negan end up working together? Why is Negan wearing a mask?**  


To get to the wagon, they need to go through the herd, so Daryl wants Negan to go as well because he has experience being among the dead. Negan refuses at first because he thinks he'll get a lot of unwanted attention from the Whisperers due to him being on the top of their killing list, but Daryl says he's got to put his ass on the line like everybody else.  


**3. ANYTHING ABOUT DOG?!**  


While Gabriel and the children are still inside the tower, the doors are barricaded and the Whisperers are banging on them. Dog starts barking loudly and runs towards the door, so Gabriel tells Judith to go get Dog, and I believe that's it. I don't remember anything else happening with him.  


**4. How is Maggie reintroduced? Does she save the day?**  
She saves Gabriel from getting killed by Whisperers at the tower after everyone's been evacuated and Gabriel stayed behind to make sure they are not followed. She's not involved in the overall horde/Whisperer situation.  


Maggie hugs Gracie first when Aaron brings her to see Maggie. Then Judith and RJ arrive, Maggie and Judith see each other from afar, recognize each other and hug. The only thing I found a bit weird here was that Maggie didn't even acknowledge RJ's presence, and no introductions were made. The scene is cut right after Maggie and Judith hug. I felt that was a bit left out.  


**5. Do Maggie and Negan interact at all?**  


No.  


**6. Who is the masked ninja? What is he/she doing in this episode?**  


The masked ninja walks in just when Gabriel is overpowered by the Whisperers. He kills all of them, and Maggie walks in right after him, saying that he's with her. We then see Aaron standing next to him and looking at him, so he has to kind of nod at Aaron.  


**7. What is Virgil doing?**  


Virgil is seen going to Oceanside.  


**8. Do we find out what happened to Connie? Is she in the episode?**  
Yes, she's alive but battered. She tries to walk for a bit but falls back down. We see Virgil on horseback finding her.  


**9. Who dies? How?**  


Beatrice is stabbed by a Whisperer while among the horde and she gets eaten. A male also dies during the Whisperer ambush on the wagon, but I don't know who he was.  


Beta also dies. Negan lures Beta away from the herd, they fight, Beta seems to overpower him when Daryl comes along and stabs Beta in both eyes. He's then devoured by walkers. I actually really liked this scene, it's hard to describe using just words, but we kind of see the death happening from Beta's perspective in sepia. He has flashbacks of Alpha, and at first, it's like the walkers are all over him, caressing him, almost kind of carrying him. Then the colors go back to normal, walkers actually rip off his mask and proceed to tear him apart.  
**10. Is Rosita in this episode? What is she doing?**  


Briefly, with the children and the rest of the families, after having been evacuated and the horde's been taken care of.  


**11. Does anyone find out about Michonne‚Äôs quest to find Rick? If so, who and what are their reactions?**  


Daryl tells Carol that Michonne has ""gone to help some people"". No mention of Rick. Daryl tells Carol that he's scared he's never gonna see her again.  


**12. In the comics there‚Äôs two big moments. One¬† where a character is gutted and hanging from a ladder and another where a character is bit on the neck saving another character. Do any of these moments happen?**  
Nope. No major theatrical deaths other than Beta's.  


**13. What is Carol‚Äôs** **story-line** **in this episode?**  
She and Lydia have a heart to heart over Alpha's death. Later on, after they lose the wagon, Lydia volunteers to be the one to lead the horde over the cliff. At the last minute, Carol says she'll do it instead, but Lydia doesn't let her go and they both end up staying alive while the walkers fall off the cliff.  


**14. Does Lydia or Judith do anything memorable?**  


Judith is reunited with Maggie.  


**15. What happens during the rest of Eugene, Ezekiel, Yumiko, and Princess‚Äô journey?**  
Eugene crashes his bike, decides to give up because they won't be able to make the rendez-vous on time, has to endure a motivational speech by Ezekiel and they decide to continue onwards and upwards.  


**16. Does Eugene finally meet Stephanie?**  


No because apparently they are late and she's no longer there, ""if she ever was"".  


**17. Do the storm trooper looking Commonwealth soldiers appear? What are they doing?**  


Yes, once the group gets to the train yard and find it empty, this time it's Eugene who gives the motivational speech on not giving up on the search when the Stormtroopers appear out of nowhere and order them to freeze and put down their weapons.  
**18. Does Aaron have any memorable scenes?**  
Just that him and Alden are not captured or killed.  
**19.** **Do Carol and Daryl make up? What do they talk about?**  


They do seem to be talking normally right from the beginning of the episode. There‚Äôs some hugging and ""you still got me"" type of lines, but nothing overly dramatic.  


**20. Assuming they do defeat the herd (and Beta), what happens with the Whisperers afterwards? Or do they all die?**  


They do, but no mention of what happens to the Whisperers or if they are any left. All I can say is that the plan was indeed to kill them all.  


**21. Anything else interesting in this episode?**  


Negan and Lydia hug  


**22. How does the episode end?**

"Rewatching the show, almost wish it‚Äôd ended at season 3.","Potential SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

The ending to season 3 was a highlight imo.  Sure it would have left a million questions and obviously the comics go on well past this point.  But seeing Rick and company come full circle back to caring about people just because brought a tear to my eye.  It felt a lot like the season 1 episode Vatos.  Taking the Woodberry people in wasn‚Äôt something they needed to do.  Most of the refugees were elderly, kids, mouths to feed and protect.  But what‚Äôs the point of surviving if there‚Äôs only a few tiny pockets of grizzled survivors?  A society should be judged on how it treats its most vulnerable imo.  And Rick and his people did the best they could for as long as they could.  Seeing the human race on the brink of extinction but still capable of compassion is likely unrealistic.  But so are Walkers right?",1,"Rewatching the show, almost wish it‚Äôd ended at season 3. Potential SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

They seem pretty rotten, even if they're recently dead, but that might be just how they're portraying flesh ripping off and recent rigor mortis. From what I've heard, The Walking Dead takes more inspiration from 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead 2004, so I'd guess it would be a virus?

Wondering if these sorts of things are explored in the game or if I'd need to watch the show.

Who do you should have died in the Negan line up now that we know where the show went and how they handled the characters who survived?,"This was probably already asked in like 2016 (damm it‚Äôs been a while since season 6/7), but now we can look at what the characters would have been doing now, and imagine what path would‚Äôve been more interesting or entertaining.

Personally I think Abraham shouldn‚Äôt have died, it made sense for the character, but it was heavily overshadowed by Glenn‚Äôs sadder, gorier, longer, more felt, and more talked about death. Also saving Abraham from his comic death a couple episodes ago then killing him was a wasted opportunity, he would have been awesome in all out war and would have been funny to see Abraham and Negan to have a one-liner face off. 

I think just killing Glenn or Maggie would have been more impactful and better.

Killing only Glenn would make Daryl feel less guilty, but just setting up the circumstance that led to the Line up could fix that, and Negan could still take Daryl as prisoner and the season carried on as normal, but with Abraham and his one liners 

Or killing Maggie, it would be sooooooo much sadder since she is carrying Glenn‚Äôs child, and you know Glenn would‚Äôve thrown that punch to Negan instead of Daryl and that Glenn would be a sobbing mess, plus in my opinion Maggie afterwards just wasn‚Äôt that great, though I did like certain moments and aspects, it just wasn‚Äôt what it could‚Äôve been. Killing her off Leaves her character in a maybe better spot than she was in after season 9 or end of season 8. Also Glenn since season 2 was driven by Maggie, it would be interesting to explore his character without her and after her death. Though Glenn probably wouldve taken Sasha or Carl‚Äôs death or have an whole episode dedicated to his death, because I think Steven Yuen requested Glenn‚Äôs death.",1,"Who do you should have died in the Negan line up now that we know where the show went and how they handled the characters who survived?

Is it worth resuming watching?,"I wanted to stop watching when Glenn died, just because I hated that, but I tried giving it a chance but lost interest just a few episodes later and then I kinda forgot about it. But this show used to be up there as one of my favourite shows ever especially around seasons 3-5 with the governor and everything. I was really attached to the characters at one point and I think that was the best part. Now that I know most of the main cast is gone, it's kinda discouraging, but if the show does get better then I'll give it a shot. What do you guys think?

I almost never see anyone talk about this (let me know what you think!),"Carl in the show was such a punching bag for the plot. Like, they would throw all these traumatic events at this child and then completely abandoned it once it wasn‚Äôt useful to the story anymore. I‚Äôve never read the comics so I don‚Äôt know how different it is but it‚Äôs kinda ridiculous how it never really affected the character afterwards. So much happens to Maggie but it‚Äôs important to her character where when something happens to Carl it‚Äôs forgotten about the next episode. Kiddo was shot in the side, shot in the eye, practically raped, had to kill his own mom and they never said anything about any of it after more than two episodes.

He has all this trauma that would be great for his character but they don‚Äôt do anything with it. Like, he could‚Äôve been really awkward since he hasn‚Äôt been around people his age, or he could‚Äôve been clingier to Michonne because she‚Äôs a mother figure and he‚Äôd be afraid of losing her. 

The very least they could‚Äôve done was imply that he hates being touched after what happened with Joe and the Claimers. The fact that it was completely ignored really didn‚Äôt sit well with me as an sexual assault victim. Idk, I just feel like the only people that talk about this are the wild fan girls on tumblr",1,"I almost never see anyone talk about this (let me know what you think!)

Best Way To Buy The Comics?,"Hello! I have loved the Walking Dead Telltale Games since they came out, and I've always wanted to read the books. I'm a big comic fan but just never committed to it. I'm looking to buy the graphic novels of TWD to start reading through them, so I can also go through the show.

I know the entire comic series can be bought in 4 Compendiums, but they're huge (1000+ pages) and that seems pretty hefty to carry around, although I could just deal with that. I thought about buying each of the 32 books seperately but that would be about twice as much cost. I definitely don't want to do Kindle, because ebooks are great but it doesn't translate for graphic novels.

What do you guys recommend? Does anyone own the compendiums, are they good quality? Are they as huge as they seem?",1,"Best Way To Buy The Comics? Hello!

The decision to kill Carl,"Hello r/twd community, I‚Äôm writing this post because I always see comments on here saying ‚ÄúWhy did they kill off Carl?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat a terrible decision to kill Carl.‚Äù Completely understandable, and first thing I want to say is I am not vouching for or against this decision. The purpose of this post is solely to give a little more insight into what went into that decision for some people who may not watch talking dead or follow twd headlines as closely as I have in the past. The youtube channel ‚ÄúMake A Path Presents‚Äù hosted by Ronny Haze is one that I‚Äôve followed closely in the past because he‚Äôs done a lot of twd insight videos and a lot of cool videos on other shows/movies and I believe he touched on the Carl decision in a video in the past. 

The first thing that writers and Andrew Lincoln have said that some people might not know is that Andrew Lincoln asked to leave the show PRIOR to filming S8. This is important to know for 2 reasons:
First, the writers were looking for a good way to write Rick out of the story starting in S8. One of them (can‚Äôt remember who) did say they considered killing him in 8.16 in the Negan standoff, which is why we got those flash forwards of teary-eyed Rick in the field, they weren‚Äôt originally sure what that was going to be. 
The second reason is that this show is all about the Grimes legacy, so once Rick was gone they needed someone to carry Rick‚Äôs legacy that couldn‚Äôt be a baby and couldn‚Äôt be Michonne. Michonne has a big role in the show of course but they wanted a child of Rick, since Carl carried on his legacy in the comics. 

I hope most of y‚Äôall are still with me. Here‚Äôs where things get controversial. As much as we love Chandler in the show, we all need to admit to ourselves that his acting in S6/7 was BAD. Now some people may have just read ‚ÄúChandler is a bad actor.‚Äù Not what I said. His acting in the last few seasons just got lazy. Now he was a high school kid who had a busy schedule which certainly could have played a factor, but I think he just got too comfortable with this job and thought there was no way he‚Äôd ever lose it and lost that drive to be better. We saw that drive come back with a fantastic S8 performance because he knew he would now need to find a new job. 
If anyone doesn‚Äôt agree his acting was poor, look at Steven Yeun and Sonequa Martin-Green, whose careers blew up after leaving TWD. (Some of you may say Sonequa booked Star Trek before leaving but it was after. The epsidoe hadn‚Äôt aired but it was a weird timing thing where she knew she was leaving the show so she was seeking other work.) Chandler Riggs really hasn‚Äôt done anything huge since TWD. He didn‚Äôt have movies and TV shows reaching out to him right away because his acting was poor near the end. 
If you need one more reason to believe it, a few months after his death episode aired, he came out on social media (twitter I think) and said he had been rewatching and admitted that his acting in the last few seasons got lazy. This shows so much character and I will always be a Chandler Riggs fan and will cheer for him to bounce back and book another big role. 

Anyway, between these past 2 paragraphs, I think the writers just decided that Chandler wasn‚Äôt the right person to carry Rick‚Äôs legacy, so we get dead Carl in 8.8/9, a second time skip in S9 (7.5 years total), and new Judith (Cailey Fleming who I already love). 

I know that was a lot and I want to reiterate that I don‚Äôt fully agree/disagree with the decision to kill Carl, I‚Äôm just saying I understand some of the reasoning. Feel free to elaborate/share your thoughts/disagree with me because that‚Äôs what reddit is for.",1,"The decision to kill Carl Hello r/twd community, I‚Äôm writing this post because I always see comments on here saying ‚ÄúWhy did they kill off Carl?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat a terrible decision to kill Carl.‚Äù Completely understandable, and first thing I want to say is I am not vouching for or against this decision.

Judith Grimes and Hershel Rhee,"Anyone else excited for these characters to meet? Their fathers were best friends. The two of them carry big legacies on their backs. Judith has Rick's hat and gun while Hershel was likely given the pocket watch that his grandfather passed to Glenn. 

A complaint I've seen about Judith is how it's jarring that she's the only child character trained in combat and treated like an adult. I think the solution is to give her a peer that is on the same level as she is, mentally and physically. Someone who can act as her foil so they balance each other out. 

I can't think of a better candidate than the son of Glenn and Maggie.",1,"Judith Grimes and Hershel Rhee Anyone else excited for these characters to meet? Their fathers were best friends.

Rick immune?,"Hey, so I know there's a lot of discussion about this subject, but in s9 the final episode with rick he is so badly wounded that he Hallucinats and Wakes up all the time. 
So can't it be maybe that he is dieing and comes back to life but as a human and not a walker?
Because it feelt like with that kind of a wound he would have probably bleed out fast. 
We also saw something similar when he got really sick and Carl thought he became a walker...and even in the very beginning shane was sure rick was dead...",1,"Rick immune?

"In my rewatch, this speech really resonated with me (Rick to King Ezekiel)","Well, when I was a kid, my mother told me a story. There was a road to a kingdom, and there was a rock in the road. And people would just avoid it, but horses would break their legs on it and die, wagon wheels would come off. People would lose the goods they'd be coming to sell. That's what happened to a little girl. The cask of beer her family brewed fell right off. It broke. Dirt soaked it all up, and it was gone. That was her family's last chance. They were hungry. They didn't have any money. She just... sat there and cried, but... she wondered why it was still there... for it to hurt someone else. So she dug at that rock in the road with her hands till they bled, used everything she had to pull it out. It took hours. And then... ...when she was gonna fill it up, she saw something in it. It was a bag of gold. All right. The king had put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out, who did something, they deserved a reward. They deserved to have their life changed for the good.... forever.",1,"In my rewatch, this speech really resonated with me (Rick to King Ezekiel) Well, when I was a kid, my mother told me a story.

Andrew Lincoln returns as a Villain on Fear,"In a recent interview Andrew Lincoln commented that he wouldn't mind returning to the Walking Dead   playing a villian. In my opinion this would be pushing it, as it would be hard to have most of cast not mention how he looked like Rick.  On Fear only 2 characters have met Rick, so having the actor return to play a different character wouldn't be as unbelievable. He easy could be just a one off villian that is encounter only a part of the cast.  Given this scenario what do you think? Could it work to have Andrew Lincoln as a villian on Fear the Walking Dead?",1,"Andrew Lincoln returns as a Villain on Fear In a recent interview Andrew Lincoln commented that he wouldn't mind returning to the Walking Dead   playing a villian.

"[spoilers] I've been bored enough to catch up on this... show, and I've gotta ask...","Why the fuck does Judith speak and behave like a 40 year old zombie apocalypse veteran? No 7 year old in the history of mankind is that thoughtful and articulate (as well as can be written on this romance drama) and you can tell that she's the not-daughter of the former over powered main character. This coupled with her aim assist head shots on zombies from 70 yards away just reeks of Gimple level ""writing."" I'm on Season 9 Episode 9 right now and I'm honestly clacking this horse shit out because watching her scene with Negan near the beginning is making me cringe so goddamn painfully hard. 

JDM has carried whatever this show became 3 seasons ago (fuck they're milking it) and he's the only reason I'm even getting this far in a rewatch, he's barely keeping the needle in the green for the diminishing returns of time spent watching compared to entertainment value received from this show, AMC is lucky that I respect my own time almost as little as they do. TWD is at a point where you watch it because it's so bad that it's good just for making fun of, rehashing the same shit every two seasons by defeating one group of people and moving on to the next, killing off some nameless friendlies and maybe a minor supporting character for the illusion of danger for the main cast that's running plot armor. 

Anyway, what plagues Judith is what plagues every other character, trying to drag this show out to 50 minutes by talking as slowly as fucking possible to fabricate drama. I can look past the other illogical bullshit, like the zombies having energy to even move after not eating for months or possibly years (I guess they ate some uranium?) is one thing, my suspension of disbelief draws the line at this 7 year old Disney character. It's backwards for her to not only have a fucking .357, but to be allowed outside, and to having some level of authority while the show also tries to present her as innocent, that is just on an entirely different level completely fucking retarded.",1,"[spoilers] I've been bored enough to catch up on this... show, and I've gotta ask...

So, TWD comics - how many of them are there? Where can I get them? Are there any prequel, sequel or other related comics? How much am I looking to spend if I want the entire collection of pretty much all the printed TWD works?

I know that's a lot of questions, but I literally know nothing of this sort of stuff...

Possibly dumb question from a noob...,"I stopped watching the show after Carl (CARL!) got bit. Not because of hating it, i just happened to not watch it anymore. Also, I never read the comics so I can only work with a little bit of knowledge.

With the new World Beyond series coming out, it seems they are going to answer the question I always had of, ""What's Next?"" But i' still curious about something. Do the comics ever show them running out of zombies to kill? It seemed likely to me that eventually the people who were able to survive the first few years of everything going to shit would be the ones to see it all the way through, like how in the middle ages if you survived passed 30 then you would likely live a long life. So do they ever realize that there are no more undead after having to kill so many over the years? Or is the population just too big for that to be shown?",1,"Possibly dumb question from a noob...

Why is Negan so charismatic?,"I would argue that Negan is one of the most likable and charismatic characters in the show currently. He obviously has depth to his character, but I can't figure out why his style of humor is so appealing. He is definitely mean and it wouldn't be fun to be mocked by him, but watching him is enjoyable to both nice people and people who are less nice, I would say. He's similar to Dr. House in that regard. 

Why is he so charismatic? Why is his character appealing psychologically, despite being mean and hurting everyone? Is it because he's confident and acts like an ""alpha male""?

"As a hardcore fan even before the TV series began, thinking VERY selfishly, I am glad the series is ending. Wondering if anyone feels the same","Before I write anything else, I want to say very clearly - I do NOT dislike the series.

Now that's out of the way, I wanted to share my thoughts now that the news has sunk in about the series ending. Ever since the TV show began, I've been watching every single episode as soon as it was available where I live (often being ""sick"" for big episodes like finales etc.). Every single episode would be an event for me, the week of anticipation for what was coming next would still feel amazing even though I knew the comics like the back of my hand. I'd watch every preview, every sneak peek of future episodes as well as a bunch of Walking Dead Youtubers and their prediction/discussion videos. (A lot of Trevschan2 before he started posting some weird conspiracy nonsense, MaPP etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll never forget watching season 6 with the anticipation of Negan finally making an appearance and even though to this day I think it could've been handled much better, it was still amazing. I thought that with season 7 the series would reach new hights, but thats when things started to feel off. Nothing really changed for me, I would still watch the episodes as soon as they aired, still kept up with discussions going on in the community, but it just wasn't the same. When season 8 rolled around I knew what All out War had in store, so again, I was very excited. Even though there were some fairly major problems I personally saw in the writing (Carl dying,a lot of Ricks decisions,infinite bullets and Eugene making them only becoming relevant in the later part of the war etc) , I still considered it my favorite series of all time. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years ago now, just before an exam I first heard the leaked news about Andrew Lincoln leaving the series, I won't lie, that actually hit me a lot harder than I'd like to admit. After 9 years, Rick Grimes would actually leave The Walking Dead. What turned out to be a massive surprise to me was that season 9 was actually amazing even without Rick, but there was still that thought at the back of my mind that something is just off. It was still Walking Dead, but I had these moments where I just thought - this has become a typical zombie show, which is a pretty dumb conclusion when you think about it - TWD IS a zombie show, but to me it was always something more.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 10 to me seems like an objectively good season, the villian is awesome and the story is gripping as hell. It has even went back to its horror roots of the first seasons. Even now, nothing has really changed, I still keep up with the show etc, but I have this weird feeling that I'm just telling myself that I enjoy the show. I don't know if it is because it has been such a long time or because a lot of major characters are no longer in the series or maybe just me not being as interested as I was before, but when I heard the news about the series coming to a formal close, I was actually kind of glad. I was sad that the journey had come to an end, but I think it had already gone astray so much that if it kept going, the whole thing may have just fizzled out (a.k.a Game of Thrones, idk about you, but i don't really see it talked about anymore pretty much at all).

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion, I think the series lost its magic somewhere along the way for me. I'm very thankful for the years of entertainment the show has brought us and the dozens of times I've rewatched it, but ultimately, I am glad it is over. And thinking that makes me feel kind of weird, I know this is just a tv series and I'm acting a little weird, but I can't help but think that I've been tricking myself into thinking that I enjoy the show for the past few years. Does anyone feel the same or am i just a wacko? Sorry for the super long post btw.",1,"As a hardcore fan even before the TV series began, thinking VERY selfishly, I am glad the series is ending. Wondering if anyone feels the same Before I write anything else, I want to say very clearly - I do NOT dislike the series.

Now that's out of the way, I wanted to share my thoughts now that the news has sunk in about the series ending. Ever since the TV show began, I've been watching every single episode as soon as it was available where I live (often being ""sick"" for big episodes like finales etc.). Every single episode would be an event for me, the week of anticipation for what was coming next would still feel amazing even though I knew the comics like the back of my hand. I'd watch every preview, every sneak peek of future episodes as well as a bunch of Walking Dead Youtubers and their prediction/discussion videos. (A lot of Trevschan2 before he started posting some weird conspiracy nonsense, MaPP etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll never forget watching season 6 with the anticipation of Negan finally making an appearance and even though to this day I think it could've been handled much better, it was still amazing. I thought that with season 7 the series would reach new hights, but thats when things started to feel off. Nothing really changed for me, I would still watch the episodes as soon as they aired, still kept up with discussions going on in the community, but it just wasn't the same. When season 8 rolled around I knew what All out War had in store, so again, I was very excited. Even though there were some fairly major problems I personally saw in the writing (Carl dying,a lot of Ricks decisions,infinite bullets and Eugene making them only becoming relevant in the later part of the war etc) , I still considered it my favorite series of all time.

What do you think is the most important thing for this upcoming Carol/Daryl spinoff to do in order to be a success?,"I think a change in setting for starters is a huge thing (Fear 1-3 was refreshing in a way because of the vibrant West Coast scenery instead of the same old backwoods).

Another added intro Easter Egg... Based on u/KyloKenobi post,,1,
Baby Judith season 6 episode 9,"In The Walking Dead season 6 episode 9 during the ""zombie guts walk"" when Jessie and Sam get killed where is baby Judith. I know Carl is carrying her when they leave the house but when he is shot and Rick picks him up to carry him it looks like he is no longer carrying her.

finally carver is dead/the walking dead season 2/END of episode 3,,1,
I just have one question regarding the season 10 premiere,"Did anyone else pick up subtle gay vibes from Dante when he was talking to siddiq, or am I just imagining things?

Cuz IICR Dante was kind of a flirt in the comics with Maggie and he kinda did that with Siddiq. Again did anyone else pick up on this, or am is it just my imagination?

If he does turn out to be gay or bi though, I got no problem with it. I mean, that‚Äôs what they did to Denise.",1,"I just have one question regarding the season 10 premiere Did anyone else pick up subtle gay vibes from Dante when he was talking to siddiq, or am I just imagining things?

What happen to that gun that Rick left in the blender? And other questions.,"Rick left a gun in the blender right before he walked into Alexandra for the first time. I remember he looked in there and it was gone.

Who took it? Were they really watching his every move from a far or something?

Also how the hell did Glenn never kill a single human throughout the events? I recall him only finally killing someone when he killed those Saviors in their sleep at the outpost. 

Also, did those Atlanta police dept/hospital people leave a bait house with food and supplies for Beth and Daryl to go to? Why waste so much food? Were those cops really putting makeup and stuff on those walkers to make them look more human again? So the whole dumb storyline was to hurt innocent people, take them in, heal them, and make them think you are in debt to them? Haha",1,"What happen to that gun that Rick left in the blender?

All the things I noticed from Season 9 episode 9-13.,"
Daryl already adapting to the new threat and looking for knives straight away.

Aaron stabs Jesus before he turns. 

The whisperer until the gate, can't wait for ""No way out"" but with whispersers.

Negan's theme playing as he walks around the new world. Really makes me miss ""Rick's despeir"" from the early seasons.

Really enjoying all the music this season, a sorta western vibe. 

Negan wearing a similar cap to Glenn when he escapes.

Negan promise to not hurt anyone, I really wonder how that's going to go down. Especially with what he does in the comics to Alpha and what Judith's reaction to that would be. 

Judith to Negan ""if I see you again, I'll shoot"" and woman of her word. 

Strangely enough Tara might be the most leave headed leader out of everyone. 

Eugene ""the living kind or original recipe"" might have to start calling walkers original recipe from now on. 

Daryl shooting walkers in the legs is genius, how the set up some sort of trip wires. Only whisperers would step over them. 

Lydia really is the weakest from the beginning. Every other whisperer charged at the enemy, Lydia surrenders straight away. 

Negan spewing up right where he killed Glenn and Abraham. 

Those dogs almost getting Negan in the store, foreshadowing for Daryl vs Negan? 

Two man bad ""symphony of awesome"" I'm ready for it. 

Luke to Alden ""She's leaving these for us to find then, it's a trail"". Yes she is, that she being Alpha that is. 

Lydia to Michonne, Tara and Daryl ""we were just trying to see if they were good people, and then you attacked us, and now there dead there all dead"" I honeslty thing she's referring to to walkers here. 
. 
Tara letting Magna's group in, she is starting up asking herself ""what would jesus do"" in that situation. 

Eugene must of thought Rosita was so disgusted by his declaration of love until he heard about the pregnancy. 

Is Negan carrying around a shovel at first because he's digging up the past.

Richie might be the most tragic walker in TWD history. He could be Seymour (frys dog) of TWD waiting for Negan, for 8 years, as a walker only for Negan to cave his skull in. 

Daryl played you like a full Henry. Got Lydia to share all the info. 


Getting real Joel and Ellie vibes from Judith and Negan.¬† ""language, I'm a kid. Asshole."" 

It seems like Alpha was using Yumikos arrows she stole from the container Mangas group stayed at before Judith saved them. 

Love the accent the more I hear it to. 

Lydia to Herny - ""my mum though, she keeps me alive, she kept me safe. She's alot like your mum you don't mess with her either."" More hyped for Alpha vs Carol than I was for Cleganbowl. 

And the straight up mirror of Carol and Alpha. Both thriving and finding themselves in the apocalypse, Alpha cut her hair to feel powerful, Carol cut hers to protect herself and eventually grew it out tm because she felt safe again. Except for Carol being the abused and Alpha being a fucked. 

The number Alpha did on Lydia. Straight up manipulating her memories of the only person to actually care about her. 

Tara kinda a great leader. Calm, straight to the point, safest option first, always taking advice. 
""the next time you want to challenge one of my decisions, just come to me first"" 

Daryl busting in as soon as Henry starts dropping to much information about Kingdom. Lydia's been train so well to find the weaknesses in a community. 

I really like Daryl having to deal with what comic Rick had to, he's attitude is so much more abrasive and to the point. Love it. Rick's ready with a speach, Daryl ""I don't give a shit"". 

Daryl and Carol seem more thematically appropriate for this arc then Rick did. With both of them going through alot of abuse in their lives and relating to Lydia is so perfect. 

Even Henry feels like he would be quicker to want to help and trust Lydia faster than Carl did. He's naivete fits so much better with this arc, Carl had been through to much for me to buy this happening to him in the comics. 
I understand why Carl relates to Lydia but feels like he's easier to fool, atleast in the beginning.

I wonder if Cassidy Mcclincy would rather suck and worm or lick Carl's eye. 

Lydia hearing that baby cry in 9x10 really makes you think. She has probably seen alot of a babies being eaten because whisperers leave them behind like in 9x11.

Jerry is precious, we need to keep him safe. In the flashback we are just finding out that Jerry and Nabila are having a child. Then in modern day he has 3. Ezekial to Jerry ""you are the future"". 

Also Jesus coming back 3 episodes after his death. So good. 

Samantha Morton is a perfect Alpha. She doesn't look much like Comic Alpha but I prefer her so much more. The pure confidence in her face. 

Daryl to Herny ""she's done talking, I ain't"" never thought Daryl would say this much hmever again. 

Jerry saying ""it's movie time"" better be the opening to the Rick films trailer. 

Lukes mask is so fucken tiny. These whisperers have a sense of humor. 

Clearing out the theater to music just shows how comfortable these people are and should be 10 years in. They have there guard up but have fun doing. 

I've read in a few places that people think this show was soft for not killing the baby but really it survived for a story reason (Alpha kills Tammy because she has the baby) and it is implied this isn't the first time this has happened. With Lydia's reaction to a crying baby to Alphas casual ordering of it.¬† 

I feel like Henry didn't start to like Lydia until she Kissed him. He just wanted to help at first. 

Connie motivation for wanting to save Lydia aren't really that clear to begin with but she has a conversation with Kelly about a child she used to have. 

Carol doesn't want to be called Queen until she uses it to support her husband. 

Lydia must smell so bad if she can still walk with the dead after changer her clothes. Wait... pretty sure they are all whisperers, point still stands, she would smell nasty af. 

Love they added a whisperer walking along side the walker in the intro. You can see the stitching in the mask and a knife. 

Glad they introduced Beta alot earlier. It always felt like Beta came out of nowhere in the comics. 

Love they kept the take where Dog broke the arrow. 

Look at Alpha cutting off a head, no problem. Right in front of Henry, foreshadowing perhaps? 

Dog really does like Connie more. Love that everyone followed Connie instead of Daryl. 

Beta talking to the dying whisperer is beautiful. 
Random Whisperer ""I am becoming one of them"" 
Beta ""but you will always be one of us"" 

For the whisperers but especially Beta, when a human dies they can join the herd and become a Gaurdian, but when a Gaurdian dies, it is like a final death for them. That's when they would mourn. 

Gaurdians is definitely the coolest name for Walker in the whole series. 

The highwaymen moving in because Carol burnt Jeds group alive. Carol makes a deal with the highwaymen, they protect the highway, they get to watch a movie. The highwaymen don't even get to watch the movie. 

Daryl to Lydia ""this beta, he their best?"" Lydia nods. Daryl again ""good, we kill him first"". The pure shock on Lydia's face is priceless. 

Herny sharpening a old stick for Lydia feels like more foreshadowing for the pike scene.

That chest with airholes in it are a pretty clever way to keep a baby safe from walkers. 

Beta to the other whisperers ""leave them NO WAY OUT"" foreshadowing for NO WAY OUT part 2?

Connie seeing the shadow flicker, then dodging the attack was perfectly timed. It really shows how she's managed to survive this long even with a disability. 

The pure fear in Daryls face after Beta tackles him. You don't see that very often. 

I feel like if Beta didn't want information off Daryl, Daryl would of definitely lost that fight. He was getting ragdolled all over the place and only manage to out apart Beta at the end. Can't wait for round 2.

Beta must be a homage to 80s horror villains, he has the mask, the slasher knifes and he survived being pushed down a fucking elevator shaft.",1,"All the things I noticed from Season 9 episode 9-13.

The main group were almost just another pack of villains,"Had it not been for Rick, they would have been just another group of bad guys. The whole thing about Shane just doing what he thought was best is bull; he was selfish and ill-intentioned from the start. Maybe he would have kept the people wanted alive for a while.

Shane is better then Rick,Just rewatching the series again before the new one starts this Sunday. During this rewatch I‚Äôve decided Shane is better then rick. At the end of the day Shane always put the best for the group over the best of the individual and Rick didn‚Äôt.

For anyone who has seen 10x01,"This is also a slight spoiler for S3 of Fear. 

Was that satellite that crashed in the premiere of S10 the same one with the Cosmonaut that Strand spoke with in S3? It would make a lot of sense and it would be a nice little nod. Not positive it is but the cosmonaut was alone in Fear so him being in a tinier satellite makes sense. If this is the case TWD has already done more for OG Fear fans than the last season and a half of actual Fear. The craft was clearly Russian and so was the cosmonaut so maybe. Hopefully we get confirmation when the episodes fully airs for everyone",1,"For anyone who has seen 10x01 This is also a slight spoiler for S3 of Fear.

Pros and Cons of the Season 10 premiere,"Pros:

* Fantastic acting from all the cast, to create a believable environment this season.
* Really creepy moments, i.e: The walker grabbing Aaron's leg; Siddiq seeing Alpha with the bloody knife
* Probably one of if not the best cold open yet, with  the satellite falling to earth and the training scene on the beach with the walkers.
* The callback to Fear the Walking Dead Season 3 (the good season) when Strand was talking to the astronaut whom I assume was from the USSR or wherever the satellite said it was from.
* The action was exceptional, from the beach scene, to the woods scene with the fire and zombies.
* The humour was excellently done, especially with Eugene looking after Rosita's baby.
* Negan's lines felt natural (THANK GOD FOR ANGELA KANG)
* The writing felt natural and realistic as it can be; and it was brilliant just like Season 9 (FTWD take note)
* The ending was brilliant, with Carol staring down Alpha, from up on high.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

* Carol could have shot Alpha from her position (though it is possible Alpha could have dodged it) so this con is a minor issue.
* Aaron taking out the walkers on the bridge, and almost dying; though Michonne calls him out for being reckless and stupid, so once again minor issue.

These are the things I personally miss in S10E1. (I STILL LOVED THE EPISODE).,"Hello TWD fans,

I‚Äôve watched the first episode of TWD and I really enjoyed it. There were a few issues I was having with the premiere.

I STILL LOVED IT IT‚ÄôS JUST WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO STILL HAVE SEEN AND HAPPEN

- Tara, I think Angela Kang did a really good job with writing Tara. I did not like her in season 7 and 8 but the storyline they gave her in season 9 really surprised me and it actually worked for me. I understand that she was killed off, but the problem is that Jesus and Enid were killed of too.
- We did not see any Hilltop. Why would I even care about the Hilltop? There is pretty much no character left from that community that is really important. Maybe they killed of Tara because they thought Maggie would return to Hilltop in S10 but now that is not happing? I think Angela Kang destroyed the Hilltop a little bit too much. Mm I just remembered that a few characters like Ezekiel now live at the Hilltop.
- When I am watching the first episode, I just DO NOT want to see Rosita, Eugene, Gabriel, Siddiq, Aaron, Ezekiel, Magna, Yumiko, Connie or any other GOOD survivor/actor to die at this moment. Kill of characters like Kelly, Jerry, Laura and just other small characters instead of the main characters.
- Why is Judith (Caily Flemming)  not in the opening credits? I want her to be instead of Andrew Lincoln and maybe even the share the Andrew Lincoln spot with the name of RJ, just the 2 names next to each other and then we see Norman Reedus.
- Just think about it how AWESOME the episode would be if we saw the grown-up version of Carl with Michonne talking with Judith and RJ about Rick. I really REALLY miss that connection point.

Rosita, Eugene, Gabriel, Aaron, Siddiq and Ezekiel are NOW one of THE BIGGEST characters in TWD and I think it would be a MAJOR disaster if we have to say goodbye to these characters. We need to have enough characters to feel we are still following this storyline and if they kill of those characters, they kill of the storylines of the earlier seasons.

Where is Morgan :/ Ugh, they need him to get back to TWD. His time on FearTWD is pointless, useless, boring and he just needs to go back to his old buddies and talking about Rick instead of helping people that do not want any help :/.

I don‚Äôt miss Dwight, never really liked the character. (I skipped a lot from S7 and S8 because I did not like any character in that season).

THINGS THAT I NOTICED AND CHANGED FROM S9

- I remembered that Michonne and Siddiq were always together. Now it‚Äôs Michonne and Aaron? Did they also want to do that in S9 but the actor that plays Aaron had not much time in S9 so they chose Siddiq instead?

Don't get me wrong. I don't hate gay people as I am one too but I wouldn't like for the show to change his sexuality from the comics. I wanna see him get his comicbook storyline and flirt with Maggie, not with Siddiq! 

Then again he could also be bi and maybe he'll get his story with Maggie once she comes back. Oh well.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø",1,"I saw the Season 10 premiere and I just have one tiny nitpick... Did they actually make Dante gay?!

[Spoilers] Theory: Everyone who knew the truth about where Maggie went died and that'll be a problem when Keys to the Future suddenly rolls up.,"Contains comic spoilers, spoilers for the final antagonists of S5 of FTWD (what group they belong to), speculation about Maggie &amp; TWD S10. 

The more we learn about the ""keys to the future"" group over on FTWD, the more dangerously b.s. they seem to be. All we know from TWD is that Maggie is apparently helping them to build settlements and start up new communities. Based on what we've seen of how Ginny rolls over on Fear, this is... quite the story for Maggie's eventual return and it sets up something kind of interesting when you consider how these two plots might cross over. 

Maggie might be in a bit of an unhinged position and she might have been taken in by Georgie and led to believe something about this group before uncovering how dangerous they really are but one thing is for sure-- she's been straight up gone from Hilltop for ages and with Baby Hershel along with her, making it more difficult for her to rebel. For Maggie to leave her people like this-- even after she needed a break-- seems odd and it's now becoming more evident that she's been pulling a Victor Strand for awhile now and long gaming this group. Now, ask yourself: if Keys to the Future has Maggie as one of their community settlers... don't you think they would want Hilltop? Don't you think the first community they'd want her to establish for them would be her own? So, what if Maggie had a plan for that? 

What if Maggie's plan was to \*pretend\* like Hilltop was part of this group so that the people of Hilltop were safe from threat by Keys to the Future? What if she left to basically say like 'yes, I am this loyal to you key-loving crazies and I will for sure help you expand! and in my stead, I'll leave my BFF Jesus to run this community that is, uh, sure, totally yours!' 

You're beginning to see the problem, right? 

If Maggie told anyone the truth about Keys to the Future and why she left, it was one or more of three people: Jesus, Tara and/or Enid. All three of them would not have told another soul in order to protect Maggie, her son, and Hilltop. All three of them are now dead. And that's if Maggie told anyone at all.

In other words, if something happens to prompt Keys to the Future to pay a visit to Hilltop, they'll roll in acting like they own the place. 

Hilltop has signed the treaty with Alexandria, the semi-fallen Kingdom, and Oceanside. They're about to go to war with the group that has Maggie and Hershel. The group that is basically a bunch of half-witted Negans pretending to be Saviors only to not exactly honor a 'people are resources' code. 

And you know who that is going to piss off. And you know who needs a redemption plot after Carol steals killing Alpha from him. And you know who owes The Widow and her son one-- a big one.

 There wasn't much attention/interest in my first post but since I had this all written, maybe a more in depth lore/script would have a different impact on people. It's been a lot of fun writing anyway so I just want to share it with others :) 

Due to a lack of character building in the recent seasons (in my opinion at least), I decided to kinda write some lore for a character, that in a way resembles me, that has some interesting links and stories since the beginning of the outbreak. The character has already been named (twice) within the show as a part of Rosita's original group from before they found Abraham and Eugene but there is little to none further information about the character.

I miss characters with a crazy background in the recent seasons, people just get introduced and killed off without much character development and I think that's a real shame.

This chapter is how Roger survives not the walkers, but the rest of the world. Which we know can be a real messed up place. The chapter plays at around the time the main TWD cast would be nearly arriving at Terminus.

 

My goal with this lore will be adding some interesting ties to existing characters, creating new characters and have the occasional ""easter egg"" in the lore, some obvious, some real deep found.

This is the first time I've attempted to write a lore or script whatsoever, so please feel free to leave any feedback or mistakes I have made, either in the story regarding locations etc, or even in grammar (as English is not my native language). TWD plays in a big universe and it's not always equally clear as to where exactly certain events happen.

 There wasn't much attention/interest in my first post but since I had this all written, maybe a more in depth lore/script would have a different impact on people. It's been a lot of fun writing anyway so I just want to share it with others :) 

Due to a lack of character building in the recent seasons (in my opinion at least), I decided to kinda write some lore for a character, that in a way resembles me, that has some interesting links and stories since the beginning of the outbreak. The character has already been named (twice) within the show as a part of Rosita's original group from before they found Abraham and Eugene but there is little to none further information about the character.

It's going to be a disappointment if Negan and Michonne...,"Don't get the respective comic stories of Negan killing Alpha and Michonne getting Andrea's death it'll be a huge disappointment.

We've had one character leave the show under mysterious circumstances (Rick) and it'd lose it's impact to have again. Michonne and Rick meeting up again is a little too fairytale for me, but Rick getting back or finding out Michonne is dead and he has a son now has a lot more impact.

And I thought they were going to cheap out or skip Andrea's storyline altogether. Show Michonne is a character analogous to comic Andrea in terms of impact. I think Ezekiel and Michonne getting together (in the trailer) will make this more meaningful and give the story more connection to other characters who are actually dead in the comics now like Ezekiel. Basically, if we want the show to be successful long-term I think the story lines need to be treated as if it's an ensemble, the front and center characters can't get everything (Daryl, Carol, Michonne), and this is a great sendoff for a good character.

Also, I'm fine with Carol 'fighting' Alpha, but Negan needs to infilitrate the camp, we need to question his loyalty, and he needs to show his worth as fucking Negan and kill Alpha. He NEEDS to get that scene, it's a bad idea to remix it, because that scene worked because it was Negan and Alpha. He shows the worth of Rick keeping him alive, even if it's in some way that Rick never intended. It shows there CAN be benefits to mercy. If Carol does some shit it becomes ridiculous cause the saviors have seemingly already seen her and just becomes another generic 'badass' moment rather than a really cool mind-fuck when it turns out Negan was for Alexandria all along.

Mostly, I hope these moments happen like this or similar. It would be a huge waste to save Michonne for the future or fakeout or even have her leave to find Rick, unless they find a comparable character for that scene (there really isn't since we know Carol and Daryl are here to stay).",1,"It's going to be a disappointment if Negan and Michonne...

"I dont know how Ive made it this far, but i have watched 11 episodes of this season of FTWD. Its been some of the *dumbest* teleivision I have ever seen. Im calling it quits now. Spoilers to that point within.","It has been such a struggle finding the motivation to keep watching this. Scott Gimple is a monster that needs to be stopped. 

In one of the opening episodes, someone holds an axe up in the air, and someone shoots it purposefully to have one bullet somehow richochet off of it and hit two walkers.

That was so fucking dumb I seriously cant believe it made it to the screen. How is no one in that writing room saying ""we cant do this, this is insane""? The scene is even worse than i am describing here, too.


Next thing to anger me is how Gimple really seems to have some sort of weird boner for making his audience hate every kid that appears in the shows universe (literally every kid is hateable but carl and judith from both shows).....but the kid group in this takes the cake. How fucking idiotic. These kids are strong and able enough to tie up living walkers by their intestines, which is dumb enough on its own, but on top of that are liars andmake every possible frustrating choice they can make all the way through.

Now I get to Alicia, arguably the shows best character.....Throughout TWD and FTWD, we have to see a million times characters going from killing everything in site, to never wanting to hurt a fly. Its been beaten to absolute death, especially by gimple. It clearly was not enough for him to have morgan take over the show, now he has alicia who went from killing a bunch of walkers like normal to save idiot children, to NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN NOT WANTING TO KILL ANYMORE.

Yeah gimple is complete poison at this point. I honestly cant believe a couple of my fav seasons of early TWD came from him..because his idea of storytelling lately seems like it was put together by a drunk 13 year old.",1,"I dont know how Ive made it this far, but i have watched 11 episodes of this season of FTWD.

""Oh i know let's send the problem to FTWD and hire two showrunners and say they don't need to watch the past 3 seasons of FEAR""

like come on. Fear's season finale was pathetic. Can AMC really let those three ruin Fear for another season?

Things that ruined Fear the walking dead,"1) killing off nick, troy, coope.

Coope didn't get enough screen time, nick was my fav character and the best character in the show along side strand and troy was a good character to have along side nick(didnt like troy tho). 

2) ofelia didn't get to meet Daniel before she died.

This just pissed me off alot.

Forbes review for the first three episodes of season 10 is out.,,1,
"I've been rewatching season 9 and taking notes as I go, in preparation for the new season. This is all the details in noticed from the first half. Anything I've missed?","All the small things from season 9 part 1.

The season being book ended by storms, the bridge from episodes 1-5 was taken out by a big storm. And the the giant snow storm after the whisperers attack. Daryl even says in episode 8 ""we should get going there's a storm coming"" right before he see a whisperer turn to look at him. 

Michonne wanting a set of rules in episode 1 and getting her charted signed episode 15. 

Every single death this season had an impact. Kenny death gave Gregory his opening to manipulate Earl and others to his side. Which lead to his execution, showing the oceanside women is okay to take revenge. Which lead to Maggie going after Negan, Daryl trying to stop Rick. Rick getting injured and blowing up the bridge. Leading to the communities drifting apart. ALL BECAUSE GETTING WENT BACK FOR THE HORSE LOL. 

Talking about characters from the past again. Ed, Merle, Glenn, Morgan, Hershal, Abraham, sasha. 

Before walkers actually showing up, we see horse spooked, leaves russeling. Instead of them ninja boys. 

Henry E02 ""I'm not going to bore my grandchildren with story's about a bridge."" - no, no you won't. 

Gabe and Anne(Jadis) ""telling it to the frogs"" 

Ezekial E02 ""I'm not giving up on my fairytale"" by the end of the season, no Kingdom, no Queen, no Prince. 

Eugene felling guilt over the saviors fingers he blew off. 

Letting Rick (the former sheriffs deputy) have a murder mystery storyline. One he doesn't even solve. 

E03 Rick talking about the future and being ready for another child. Super sad that he may never meet RJ. 

""No exception"" being the final nail in the coffin for Arat. Before that I beileved Maggie would of let her go but those are the words Negan said before Glenn's death. Wow. 

Negan's theme playing over Michonne walking away after using bat. 

Treating herds like a natural disasters is great fun. 

Negan to Michonne E04 ""You're not scared you're like me, you're scared you're going to end up like me"" then Negan asks about Lucille and now in the season 10 trailer Michonne holding Lucille. 

Rick to Daryl ""brother, brother take my hand"" as he pulls him out of the hole. That has to be a call back to that hallucination of Merle talking shit about about Rick. Back when Daryl got kicked of the horse in season 2.

Maggie beating a walker to death ""Lucille styles"" before going to see Negan. 

Morgan, Lori, Abraham""what's you're wound"" playing over Rick's hallucinations.

Okay Gimple shit showrunner but this dialogue between Shane and Rick is perfect. 

Then that transition from Shane to Walker was spot on. 

Judith being excited about Maggie. She has to be the season 10 cliffhanger. 

Maggie to Michonne ""if you had a child to raise alone because of him, he would of been dead along time ago and you know it. A couple of hours before Rick's"" death"". Fucken hell. 

Not seeing Negan's face clearly until Maggie drags him into the light and seeing his pathic ass face. He wants to die so bad. 

Scott Wilson final acting role being Hershal Green. Now I'm crying. 

Beth and Amy in the pile of body's. I'm sure there is alot more. 

Not resolvimg the fight from E04 until we see a bunch of fresh walkers at the camp in E05. 

Rick finally found his family, so he's able to let go and die peacefully. Beautiful ending to Rick's journey on this show. 

That 6 year time jump introducing Connie, Magna, Luke, Yumiko, Kelly and Judith to us is the perfect fucking ending holy shit. 

Seeing that bird feed her chicks with a worm out of a walker makes me think Lydia didn't just eat worms out of the grounded. 

Eugene's confidence in kill walkers makes me so happy. 

The kingdom falling apart is set up start away, with Henry wanted to learn how blacksmith, so he can actually fix things. No wonder it falls apart without him. He passion is also set up in his first scene post time jump. Clearly wanted to help everyone. He wants to help The kingdom, the saviours that trick him, Lydia even tried to go out to help get Eugene. Henry beileves in helping so much it ends up getting him killed. 

Totally understand why Michonne doesn't want Magnas group here knowing everything that happens in ""Scars"". 

Henry being a dreamer just like Ezekiel. 

I feel like Connie being a badass journalist will come back. She has doubt with politicians, she might have to deal with them again. 

Rosita and Eugene getting ambushed at the water tower, you can definitely see the whisperers leading them. 

Mud pushed Henry over and Carol sets 20 ish people on fire. I can't even imagine what she will do to the whisperers. 

Even though I love Jesus's death, I wish we had more Jesus and Tara running hilltop together. They have a fun dynamic. 

That stradivarius is the most tragic death this season. 

Luke is such a great character, he's definitely going to die next season. I hope I wrong so bad though. His little laugh when stopping walkers with car doors is great, only to be attack from behind. Genuinely funny. 

Michonne putting down the Benny walker from Magna's group was really moving. With his ugly as shirt. 

The whisperer theme being play before we have seen a single whisperer but they've seen our people, is so great.

Loved how prepared hilltop is for an attack. Didn't take them long at all to get back into the walls, when Michonne arrived with Magna's group. 

I really want to know what happened between Maggie and Michonne, Michonne was made to disarm before coming into Hilltop. Did Michonne attack her. I hope if Lauren comes back Danai will too, for flashbacks. 

First thing Henry learns how to make his a spear head. Ironic as hell. 

The Gabriel and Negan scenes are 100, need more of these.

From when Daryl, Jesus and Aaron find Eugene it's pure horror and I love it. 

Bringing Dog in now, for Daryl, is perfect. He can help take, distract walkers and just overall show Daryls compassion is still there after Rick's disappearing. Also must be great for Daryl to actually save a dog, there was that one from season 4 that ran away. 
 
Was that one hilltop kid going to piss on a walker? Twd rule 34.

Henry's locked up the same time Negan gets out. 

The joy on Jesus/Toms face while fighting walkers. Going out doing what you love, that's all you can ask for. 

Having that be Jesus was the right call. Not only was the actor getting bored. His death is a much more impactful/iconic way to introduce the whisperers than in the comics and it's a great way to establish a new threat. 

Also this is how you do a cliffhanger. Answer a couple questions and leave our heroes in danger, a real ""how will they get out of this one"" situation. Like the season 4 cliffhanger.",1,"I've been rewatching season 9 and taking notes as I go, in preparation for the new season. This is all the details in noticed from the first half.

Bringing Dog in now, for Daryl, is perfect. He can help take, distract walkers and just overall show Daryls compassion is still there after Rick's disappearing. Also must be great for Daryl to actually save a dog, there was that one from season 4 that ran away. 
 
Was that one hilltop kid going to piss on a walker? Twd rule 34.

Henry's locked up the same time Negan gets out. 

The joy on Jesus/Toms face while fighting walkers. Going out doing what you love, that's all you can ask for. 

Having that be Jesus was the right call. Not only was the actor getting bored. His death is a much more impactful/iconic way to introduce the whisperers than in the comics and it's a great way to establish a new threat. 

Also this is how you do a cliffhanger. Answer a couple questions and leave our heroes in danger, a real ""how will they get out of this one"" situation. Like the season 4 cliffhanger."

Michonne and the baby formula,"I‚Äôve found it interesting that Michonne‚Äôs first appearance with the core group was when she brought baby formula for Judith. Probably unintentionally done but it was the ultimate foreshadowing. Michonne ends up her mother far into the future and it all started by bringing her formula. 

You could tell when Michonne watched Glenn and Magee get kidnapped that she didn‚Äôt really know what to do but she took a leap of faith...that decision changed her life forever. Pretty cool.",1,"Michonne and the baby formula I‚Äôve found it interesting that Michonne‚Äôs first appearance with the core group was when she brought baby formula for Judith.

Imo,the first 3 seasons where amazing(story wise)and most characters where very human about decisions (not over the top drama kinda thing)and most characters (again,in my opinion)where we'll written,and for me,it's like the  first 3 seasons was trying to make you addicted to the show,which is good,and I got really into it until I reached season 5-7,it seems like the writing slowly went downhill post Alexandria,some episodes kinda felt over the top dramatic,not to mention,plot armor in some episodes,season 4 was Meh for me,season 7 was a drag for me,season 8,found it enjoyable,and season 9 they screwed up with the new antagonist group the whisperes,the idea was good on paper but executed really poorly imo,idk,seasons 1 to 3 characters and the story felt more natural,and the emotions were there for me (cried once or twice)

Milton Mamet vs. Eugene Porter,"A bit silly but I had heard that the decision to kill off Merle, Andrea, and Milton was made during season 3's production. I had heard that before that, the characters were set to make it to season 4 before the change was made to the script. I'm to assume then that if they had all lived into season 4, they would have been part of the group. (Or maybe Andrea was set to become leader of Woodbury like was originally intended.)

I'm just curious how hilarious the meeting of Milton and Eugene Porter would have been since both were intelligent men who made it in the apocalypse and who were not fighters.

*Eugene: I hypothesize that I am the most intelligent of this group of survivors and, as a result, would be the most important.*   
*Milton: ..... I find that hypothesis lacking in evidence and disagree with your findings on the matter.*  
*Eugene: .... I find that highly offensive. And downright just plain wrong. It is you, sir, who is in the wrong.*

What does everyone else think? Would Milton have figured out that Eugene was full of it back in season 4/season 5? Would Eugene have protested and been worried because another ""brain"" was part of the group? Would Abraham and Merle have thrown hands (haha) because they each back up their respective nerd?

S4: E6 Live Bait is the complete compassionate, human side left of ""The Governor"" in it's full beauty. The writing of this episode was so well thought through.

Just finished season nine! OMG!,"It took me this long because season eight really killed the series for me. I thought it was easily the worst season of the series. I got caught up on other shows and made the decision to watch season nine once Netflix put it on.

Season nine was amazing! Light years better than season eight. I can't remember the last time an episode made me cry. Season nine managed to make me do it twice (episodes 5 and 15).

I didn't look look up anything for this season, didn't talk about it, etc. because I thought I was done watching the show. Everything that happened, the people that died, all of it was a surprise to me. I got to watch an entire season spoiler-free and it was amazing. ""The Calm Before"" might be too three episodes ever.

Anyway. There is no real point to this post other than me wanting to let all of you people who do not care about me that I'm very happy the I decided to give the show another shot. Can't wait for season ten!",1,"Just finished season nine! OMG! It took me this long because season eight really killed the series for me. I thought it was easily the worst season of the series.

Ever wondered?,"How good the show could of potentially been without following the comics?

Been a fan of the show since the start and will watch it through to the very end no matter what, even after some rougher seasons it will go down as one of my favourite shows of all time. But during the break I had a thought one day, what if they never followed the comic story-lines and went a completely different direction and wrote a separate story start to finish and introduced whatever characters they wanted.

Is Anybody Really Convinced He's Not Coming Back?,"I can definitely see Andrew not returning until after the trilogy is done with. But is anybody convinced he's staying gone forever from the show?

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think it's likely he will return to the show in a few years and/or for at least the final season, if the show ends sooner.

&amp;#x200B;

After all, his reasoning is that he wants to stay close to his kids, which by this point, will have been 4 years later. That's quite a bit of time home. If he returned even for a final season, that would not be too significant of a time away. We know he loves the character and wants to continue. And we know AMC would have him back in a heartbeat if they could. Imagine the ratings boost alone.

I don‚Äôt understand why season 9 is liked?,"Usually I agree with the general consensus from online reviews. But season 9 TWD was absolutely diabolical. 

It was so slow, they introduced so many new characters which were just poorly acted, how the current characters present themselves now is just an illogical switch. 
I had to stop watching the episode when Carol says ‚Äúwhen was the last time you went to the Cinema?‚Äù oh my life, I pulled the muscles in my face from cringing so much.

Henry was just a jackass that should‚Äôve never have got given such a big part in the series. 

The finale was just a filler episode when fuck all happened. Although it was fitting because fuck all happened the entire season. 

The best characters Rick, Eugene, Maggy, Negan were given no screen time but im thankful. Because King would‚Äôve spoiled them. The only character that remained good was Daryl as he finally got a bit of depth. 

I have a theory that Rick was meant to be in this season but when he watched through he said he didn‚Äôt want to be associated with this dog shit.

[S9 SPOILERS] First time watcher giving my thoughts on each season. Just finished Season 9.,"So I‚Äôm caught up. Other seasons are in my history.

Season 9

1. Man Gregory suuuuuuucks.
2. I was wondering when they‚Äôd run out of gas. It was starting to push the limits of believability. Particularly when they‚Äôd take 5 cars out at a time when 2 would suffice. 
3. Rick is a dumdum. Negan has to die. No, Negan doesn‚Äôt become a martyr. They didn‚Äôt worship Negan, they followed him because he was the strongest, and as long as he‚Äôs alive, they feel there‚Äôs a chance he takes control again.
4. I‚Äôm not normally a fan of long time jumps, but I feel like this show needed it, so we will see how it goes. I think 6 years may be a bit too much, though.
5. Michonne finding toilet paper made me realize I didn‚Äôt even give a thought to how they‚Äôd been handling that. 
6. I am definitely down with Badass Eugene!
7. How the hell does Gabriel get Rosita?? I‚Äôm still waiting on my Rosita to come along.
8. Oh great, another little kid that‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúthe conscience,‚Äù because that hasn‚Äôt already been overdone on this show.
9. So, I watch with subtitles, and uhhhh, walkers can talk now?
10. Hmmm...X marks the spot scars on both Michonne and Daryl that they didn‚Äôt have before the time jump. A little too obvious with the drawing attention to it, though. I think a little more subtle hints would‚Äôve been better.
11. Uhhh...walkers can wield weapons and duck and fight now? Yea, no, I‚Äôm not buying that they‚Äôre ‚Äúevolving.‚Äù 
12. Ohhh that makes more sense. People hiding as walkers. I guess they‚Äôre just cannibals, walking among them.
13. I‚Äôve been saying I wanted more flashbacks, and they delivered. Phenomenally done. The first flashbacks just felt a little off. For one, my mind went ‚Äúhuh, the tattoo of the daughter‚Äôs name on the arm seems more like a dad move than a mom move.‚Äù And the cutting the beard just seemed really strange. So when the story pieces fell together, being revealed to Lydia at the same time as the audience, it was just perfect. She remembered the details, but the lie had overshadowed them, so her mind tried to make the details fit the lie. Not sure how I feel about a group of Buffalo Bills, but that flashback sequence was incredible.
14. I am very impressed with Cassady McClincy‚Äôs acting. She is doing a great job with her body acting of someone who is so closed off and showing evidence of abuse. It‚Äôs the little things, like making herself smaller and crossing her arms to clutch herself.
15. So at first I thought Magna was with Yumiko because of how they were sitting together in one scene. Then Magna made a comment to Enid about her and Luke being a thing. So, okay, I was wrong. But then Magna and Yumiko kiss. So...freaky threeway or she just meant she really cared about Luke but not in that way? I vote polygamy.
16. Not Enid!! Damn it. And also, uh, how the hell did they sneak in and kidnap 10 people? Like we see people manning the gates. They could get in dressed up as Alexandrians or Hilltoppers, but how do they get them out? That‚Äôs a pretty gigantic plot hole. If they had killed the people sent to protect Hilltop, then play, they ambushed them on the road. But there‚Äôs no way they got 10 people from inside of Kingdom and got them out without being seen.
17. So I guess the Skins went South for the winter? There‚Äôs not event a hint of snow. Kind of a weird finale.

I do feel like a 6 year time jump was a little too much. I think 3 years would have been best. For one, you‚Äôve got people like Enid who definitely didn‚Äôt age 6 years. Sure they cut her hair and changed her makeup, but she didn‚Äôt seem 6 years older. Just made it weird. But of course, without it being 6 years, then they can‚Äôt age-up Henry enough for his storyline to work. 

I‚Äôm also surprised that Rick‚Äôs storyline just ended. Unless they have a good explanation in S10, I don‚Äôt buy Rick just not trying to get back to them for 6 years.

Honestly, this felt like two competing seasons jammed into one. Some stuff was rushed while other bits were drawn out. And once again they largely skipped over the parts I‚Äôve been wanting to see - rebuilding society, politics, trying to live normal. There were always snippets of it, but I‚Äôve been wanting a season where there is no Big Bad.  Where it‚Äôs just the living trying to live. Season 2 was like that, and it‚Äôs probably my favorite, though you could argue Shane was the Big Bad. I‚Äôd disagree, but you could argue it.

Anyway, I‚Äôm caught up, and I‚Äôd say overall that it was pretty enjoyable. But it‚Äôs definitely (in my opinion) a show that should be binged because of the disjointed storytelling that they‚Äôve leaned on like a crutch for about 4 seasons now. 

Final thoughts:

If you had told me that Carol and Daryl would be the only OGs left, I would have believed Daryl, but definitely not Carol. 

Judith isn‚Äôt as annoying as Carl, but we‚Äôll see if that stays true. Carl‚Äôs biggest issue was that he survived too long that he overstayer his welcome as a character.

RJ doesn‚Äôt look like a 5-6 year old at all. Really weird that they would cast a kid that looks 3 when he has basically no role other than being on screen.

Anyway, that‚Äôs all from me. I plan to do this as well for S10, where I‚Äôm tracking my thoughts as the season goes on, but I also plan to be active in the sub during the season, so it might look a little different.

Anyway, that‚Äôs all from me. I plan to do this as well for S10, where I‚Äôm tracking my thoughts as the season goes on, but I also plan to be active in the sub during the season, so it might look a little different. Hope y‚Äôall enjoyed."
How did you get introduced to TWD?,"I knew nothing of The Walking Dead until my senior year of high school when season 2 was just airing.

My The Walking Dead spin off plotline,"&gt;Tried posting before but kept getting auto-removed. Figured I'd try again! a month later.....

[Survive The Walking Dead](https://i.imgur.com/Hjy0Uur.jpg)

A rewrite of the first season. I had posted my ORIGINAL draft here before, but this one is different. This includes some character changes/removal of some characters. Name changes. Plot changes. The core is still the very same if anyone had read the original, but this is very different too.

STORYLINE: Set 4 months into the outbreak (Rick and Co. are currently dealing with the loss of Sophia and Shane's downward spiral into madness), a small group left alive at a small FEMA shelter set up at an old motel in Austin, Texas- similar to that of Telltale's game, issues arise within the group causing tension. People's allegiance is tested, as the groups very safety is threatened by an ever-looming herd that is heading in their direction. 

I wil post Season 2 tomorrow if all goes well! I hope you guys enjoy!

--------------------

LIST OF CHARACTERS:

[Colton ""Colt"" Hayden](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1036181/) - A used car salesman before the apocalypse. He is a sweet, charming, charismatic, and nice person everyone looks up to him to lead, despite feeling like he isn't capable of such a position.

[Scott Williams](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1058987/) - A more stern character. He is Colt's right-hand man, as Colt feels Scott is far more fit for the leadership role.

[Alex Dumois](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2113653/) - Harder. He's far too advanced for this world (Very similar to the likes of Shane), he's manipulative and cunning and doing whatever it takes to get his way.

[Michael Scoldier](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664499/?ref_=tt_cl_t8) - Believes in ""Shoot first, ask questions later"". Isn't the type of guy who takes shit lying down. He gets the job done under *any means necessary(

[Anna Brannon](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088127/) - A quiet yet shy girl, lovable. She's polite when she does speak, but she's usually very shy. She's a bit of an artist and loves to draw. She has a bit of a crush on Adam. She's always trying to bring an uplifting spirit everywhere she goes.

[Adam Cospen](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893257/?ref_=tt_cl_t3) - The main guard. Very polite, religious, believes everything happens s for a reason. Has a bit of a crush on Anna.

Scott confronts Alex, but Alex causes a fight - punching Scott square in the jaw. Colt locks Alex in one of the motel rooms that had a busted lock (Can only be locked/unlocked from the outside) as a sort of imprisonment. Scott tries to convince Colt that Alex is too much of a liability to keep around, but Colt refuses to listen to reason. A few Roamers attack the settlement as the community finds a hole in the fence behind the motel. Adam explains his time as a youth pastor, how he used to help reform troubled kids and thinks Alex could benefit from this, despite Alex not being a child.

The man cracks a few jokes and manages to make Scott laugh a few times. The man explains he uses comedy and sarcasm as a coping mechanism. he hides behind it to deflect from the real world and explains how he has an anger problem that's got him kicked out of quite a few nightclubs he was doing stand-up at. The man reveals himself as Kevin. Scott thanks him for saving his life. Kevin tries to help clean the wound but isn't too sure what to do. Come morning, the herd has mainly passed as Scott asks Kevin if he's willing to join their community. Kevin says no, but after some coaxing, decides to anyways. As the episode ends, Scott and Kevin roll up to the gates of the FEMA shelter. Alex realizes he's fucked. The camera pans up to reveal the herd isn't too far behind and would hot the community a few hours. 

Episode 6 ""Karma"" - Flashback time! John and Colt are hanging out, outside of work, in Colt's back yard. Having some beers and eating, with Colt's fiance, Heather.

Possible SHOW Spoiler? Did I stumble across something? Or am I reaching here?," [https://imgur.com/a/BPhqU9t](https://imgur.com/a/BPhqU9t)   


Someone posted these pictures on a facebook group (good detective work whoever snapped these pics) about a possible international space station crash that happens this season.  


That got me thinking... why would they even do this OR include this in the show? So, I sat on it and thought about it quite a bit... and I have a crazy theory that kinda makes sense.... maybe?  


So, astronauts lived up there since before the virus, had enough supply for 10+ years (if they lasted that long seems like a stretch but you never know right?) and they know of the crazy crap going down on earth... have no choice but to risk landing in the ocean (aka ocean side) but crash on the way down.... Our crew check their bodies, they are dead... dang.... buuuuut.... they didn't turn. No head trauma or anything. Could be possible they died of starvation up there as well, who knows. Either way, they should have turned... BUT THEY DIDN'T.

Opens up a whole array of questions... why didn't they turn? Clearly something on earth (as we know) caused everyone to be infected.... but its possible space was fine, and even as they landed, the infection should have reached them when they broke through the atmosphere (to our knowledge its fast acting since the virus spread so freaking fast ala; Fear the Walking Dead). So if that's the case, maybe they will confirm its an air born virus that has since been cleansed on earth over the years and that new population (Judith, RJ/ any kid born after apocalypse started or maybe a few years after it started) are NOT infected at all.  

And the more you think about it, the more it makes sense. The third walking dead series follows kids.... 

Synopsis: ""The series would focus on the first generation of children that have grown up during the zombie apocalypse, and are aware of how to survive if confronted by them, but have otherwise been raised behind walls and have never actually experienced survival.""

I mean.... a show focused on kids, with the potential of the virus actually being gone now... the only people who CANNOT turn are KIDS now....  


TL;DR: No zombie astronauts.... just a few dead people who should have turnt, but didn't, opening up a whole can of worms of the potential that all kids born after the virus started are actually 100% infection free.",1,"Possible SHOW Spoiler?

What happened to the emphasis on music?,"The show used to have a real emphasis on music with characters having their own songs in a sense; the songs marked a change in character or an important arc.

Such as: 

Clutch - the regulator 
The song plays as Rick kills someone for the first time, in the episode Nebraska S2E8.

Wye Oak - Civilain
18 Miles out S2E10, song plays during, IMO, one of the best scenes of the series - where Shane stares at a lone walker in a field.

Ben Nichols - last pale light in the west
I cant remember what episode this song plays, but its deemed the governors song.

Ben Howard - oats in the water
Hershels song. Plays as he re-enters the quarantined area of the prison during the outbreak of the killer illness.

I can name many more as a lot of them are just great songs and artists in general (check all of Ben Howard's stuff out - truly a great artist)

Anywho, these songs had such an impact and really became a part of the character, and besides once in season 9, the music hasn't really been a big part of the show anymore -- yet again, just an opinion. Would really have loved to see those songs make another appearance for us big fans of the show.

Clutch - the regulator should have been played at some point during all out war, would have been awesome.",1,"What happened to the emphasis on music?

My theory about Rick is they(the writers) decided that Negan would take over as leader and they would kill off Rick. His disappearing was the writers testing the water to see how fans felt about him not being around. They have really been making Negan a likable character. I personally like Negan,,1,
Tracking,"Right, this is something that has confused/bugged me for a while. In TWD, the Walkers tracked Rick and Co. (From the Quarry IIRC, then got distracted by Negan's attack on Alexandria) so they were closely following, though if I remember right, there were a few who wandered off. However, in Season One of the Game, how did they track the train? They were seen at the Overpass, which at a rough guesstimate, would be a good few dozen miles from Savannah. And the train, I'd expect would be going at a decent speed, probably about 60mph. So how come, all of a sudden, you've got a hoarde of walkers who managed to follow a train that was many days ahead of them. Yeah, I get it, it was for plot progression, but it just doesn't make sense when you look at it...",1,"Tracking Right, this is something that has confused/bugged me for a while.

The biggest disappointment for me.,"Since I'm 1/2 way through season 9, I can reflect back on this show and if I consider all the various aspects of what makes a show good, I believe I have pinpointed where this show falls short. 

It certainly isn't the concept, nor the cast, neither the directing or the production value. The effects team also did a great job. There are some very likable aspects to the show. 

The show starts off as people on a journey into the unknown who have some idea of where they want to go, or somewhere they should be. However every time they attempt to get there they get side tracked. 

At first I mistook this for a mechanism often found in computer based adventure games. Where you the hero often start with a destination in mind or a particular goal but get totally carried away into what seems like a never ending sub quest or story line. However in video games you usually solve something and get back on track to your destination. 

Having a definite goal or destination in mind keeps the audience engaged. It makes them get behind the characters hoping they'll overcome so they will get on with the epic journey ahead of them. 

This is very similar to the Hobbit. You as the audience don't mind and actually enjoy watching characters seemingly get ""stuck"" in certain areas, because you know they'll persevere and you know right from the very start what the end destination is. 

The walking dead teases with destinations, but they're all ignored. 

What happened when Eugene and Abraham first made contact? They had a destination! A destination and a plot. A plot that sounded exciting and a mysterious possible end to all of this, or at least far more answers. 

None of that ever materialized. What was supposed to be a smallish group of survivors struggling to make their way across the country, where the writing opportunities are open with potential, instead the show ended up taking a ""put down roots approach"". 

And it seems once Abraham died, or at least once the saviors show up, the talk about getting Eugene to where he needs to be to save the human race gets long forgotten and never mentioned. 

I find this all extremely disappointing. Also later in season 9, there's evidence that even helicopters are still operational. Surely one of them could fly Eugene and a small team to this base where he could start working on a cure, as he claimed he could. 

So yeah. I just found the settle down ""take roots"" approach to be the wrong direction for this show. Would have been far better as an ""On the move"" with a destination in mind, and an inner core cast who mostly survived the ordeal.",1,"The biggest disappointment for me.

# Fear TWD - Seasons 1-3

In 2015, AMC announced that their widely popular and highest-rated show would be receiving a prequel spin-off, following a NEW group of people separated from Rick Grimes, set in sunny Los Angelas!

Everyone was stoked! excited! energetic! We were FINALLY going to see how the Walkerpocalypse started! (Or so, most thought.)

On August 23rd, 2015 - Fear The Walking Dead aired its first episode. Invoking, mystery and *fear* into the show from the start. Being the MOST-WATCHED PILOT IN TELEVISION HISTORY *EVER*! Everyone was expecting non-stop, quick-paced, high-action-packed sequences like they've become so used to on The Walking Dead.

It also doesn't help that we were promised something that wasn't fully delivered. The viewers felt cheated. Lied too. Annoyed. (It also doesn't help we've been watching The Walking Dead for 5 years prior, so we were already caught up on everything, so watching a NEW BATCH of people doing what we already saw uncovered in TWD was a bit of a drag for most. Despite being realistic. I guess people wanted them to just... brush over all of that?) Regardless though, for whatever reason (AMC didn't want to fork over the budget and Kirkman wanted to keep most things a mystery) the apocalypse was reduced down to 4 episodes. With the rest only briefly touching upon this.

People began to tune out. It doesn't help that they found Madison a bitch (Despite that being the entire purpose) with lack of emotion (debatable, but still... the entire purpose.) and they were getting annoyed of these characters doing stupid things. Even though, NONE OF IT was *truly* stupid, because these people are NEW to this world. WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. They have not.

Viewers didn't know WHAT in the hell they wanted, because they complained either way.

Fear was ALWAYS intended to be on its own. (Despite Gimple saying it's ""always been planned"" but we all know he speaks out of his ass because he's a god-damn fucking dumbass.) People complained that ""THe wAlkER's wEreN't sCArY"" so ""WhErE iS tHe FeAr In FeAr ThE wAlkIng DeAd"" because I guess they missed the point of the name. (Remeber Rick Grime's speech? It's ripped straight from the comics. ""We ARE the Walking Dead."" and that same speech applies here. The show was NEVER about the zombies (despite being the main reason most people watch it.) Kirkman himself has stated that the zombies are just a backdrop. The story is about the survivors. How a post-apocalyptic world can change a man. How They're pretty much dead already because no matter what... *they're all infected.* Even if they're alive. They're not. They ARE *The Walking Dead.*

That same logic applied here. See, Dave Erickson had referenced Breaking Bad as one of his main sources of inspiration for this show. What was Breaking Bad's purpose? *To break a man. To turn a man from Mr. Chips to a cold-blooded killer.* What was Fear's intention? *To turn an ordinary family into a group of morally grey villains. To turn Madison into Negan. The Governor.* Madison wasn't designed to be any other villain. She was intended to be a villain to everyone else, but more importantly her family. She was her **families** villain. *She was* ***Nick's*** *villain.* This was a slow-burn. We had to see how these people got there. It's not as easy as Fear NOW likes to make it (Oh No MY HUsBanD Died And No oNe woUld HelP Him, Now Ima  FIltHy villain."" or ""My TrUck ran Out Of GAs so NoW i'M a BaD GuY"" What the FUCK kind of logic is THAT bullshit???) We had to see these characters develop. Rise to power. See what in the apocalypse FORCES THEM down this Path. People didn't like the slow burn character-study that Fear was intended to be. They wanted non-stop action-packed, long-winded speeches and unnecessary powerful Walker herds like Gimple made SOO prominent on The Walking Dead. Fear tried to be what TWD was always intended to be while incorporating people *breaking bad* (Hailing from Virginia as far back as 1919, means to raise hell and break a person.)

Fear season 1 and 2 had some really great moments. Some really great characters. (I even liked Chris. Don't @ me.) Sure, the writing wasn't anything too special. But it wasn't *bad* by any means. (Except that one line in 1x01 ""Boom! Killshot bitch!"" Yeah sorry... no teenagers talked like that. Not even in 2010.) And if you binge the seasons, S2 is probably the CLOSEST we got to the non-stop action that plagued TWD (Before S4+5...)

Than... season 3 came along. All of the characters past actions came to a head as you FINALLY begin to understand what these characters were doing. Why they were doing. What made them do it. You found yourself questioning these people and asking... ""Are they the good guys?"" Madison was a manipulative, scheming, bitch. She was ALWAYS intended to be this way. It wasn't bad acting or bad writing. And people finally began to understand this. People finally began to understand what the word *Fear* meant in fear The Walking Dead. *We were supposed to Fear Madison and her family (we ARE The Walking dead).* Fear season 3 came equipped with an (almost) entirely new writing team (Save for a few select people) but with Erickson still at the helm.

2 years of build-up. 2 seasons of constant shit from fans to FINALLY get to season 3. The season where Erickson could FINALLY begin to cross the ""Morally grey"" side into ""Oh shit, these guys are fucking insane... I don't think these are the god guys..."" Before AMC decided to anally fuck him with a large metal rod.

Because of the backlash Fear got in the first 2 seasons, they gave Erickson ONE more season to tell his story to ""move him onto other AMC properties"" (Which is fancy for ""FIRED!"") and they began to look for the cheapest people on the market that could be their Yes Man like Gimple, while they give them under the table blowjobs.

AMC was NOT expecting the praise season 3 got and even LESS expecting of the Madison fandom building up. But they didn't care. They thought people still wanted to see TWD.

Erickson closes out his season with a bang. Only leaving ONE character fate confirmed and leaving EVERYONE ELSE open-ended, as Madison was the MOST IMPORTANT character to Fear. In his opinion. ***You know, THE SHOW'S GOD DAMN FUCKING CREATOR!***

And now... that leaves us here. October of 2017, Announcing that ""Worlds collide"" (When it really should have said ""COMPLETE TAKEOVER"") BEFORE Erickson's season EVEN FINISHED AIRING. That's how egotistical and Greedy AMC was.

And here we are. 2018. The year Fear changed.... forever.

# Fear seasons 4+5 and the crossover

Starting with a HUGE time jump, Fear season 4 opens up roughly 2 years after the dam exploded, with a new character (Who seemed promising at first)  who meets Morgan Jones. A character who, much like John Dorie, was once a promising character, now reduced to nothing more but a [2D closed-loop character](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/cn36he/morgan_stopped_being_interesting/) who, Gimple's idea of character development is making him switch between ""All life is precious"" and ""CLEAR!"" (Oh yeah, great fucking writing Gimple.)

Fear was changing... rapidly. clearly. And it wasn't for the better.

What fans Fear did have, were left confused, puzzled, and angered at the fact they the story they stuck through, for better and worse, was left in the dust. Only passing responses to fill in a plot-hole these writers didn't want to explain or build upon.

AMC Made Fear a carbon-copy of The Walking Dead. Changing all the characters personalities to better fit their writing style (Which is fairytales and shitty fanfiction.) They removed the MEANING of the word Fear, and only kept it to pass it off as the same show. even though it's very... clearly... disastrously not.

AMC only catered to ONE side of the fandom, and that was TWD side. They didn't cater to those who ONLY liked fear and didn't like the flagship (For all the reasons I stated in the last heading). they didn't cater to those who have been watching this show for 3 YEARS. They only catered to those who liked TWD. When they COULD HAVE ***AND SHOULD HAVE*** catered to BOTH sides of the parties. It's NOT impossible to blend the two. It's not impossible to make Fear a show that stands on its own and follows these characters down a villainous path, while still giving the new fans they tried to bring over that sweet TWD juice they like so much (despite being flat and watered down now from Gimple's era.) Hell, crossing Abraham over for HALF A SEASON still blends the 2 nicely. I'm doing it. Dozens of others HAVE done it. If AMC truly gave a shit about the OG fandom and STILL wanted to draw in kore viewers, Abraham made more sense. But why go with logic when we can go with filthy ladies and hot air beer balloons!

Fear, a show that took PRIDE in being a nearly STANDALONE entity (Only taking PLACE in the same universe as TWD), was now reduced to a show where they could promote the main show. Makes perfect fucking sense.

Crossing Morgan over, CHANGING THE KEY FUNDAMENTALS OF WHAT MADE FEAR... ***FEAR,*** KILLING THE ***ONE CHARACTER***  DAVE CONFIRMED ALIVE BECAUSE HE (THE SHOWS ***FUCKING CREATOR FOR FUCKS SAKE)*** THOUGHT SHE WAS IMPORTANT! And... AMC gave Morgan the lead. Morgan. A man who was NEVER ON FEAR, to begin with. WHO WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO APPEAR ON FEAR... the fucking lead. [Opposed to an ACTUAL FUCKING OG!](https://www.reddit.com/r/FearTheWalkingDead/comments/d6akl4/making_morgan_the_lead_on_fear_in_s4_was_fucked_up/) (That's like making Alden the lead after Rick's death, opposed to the fucking OG's.

Crossing Morgan over, DESTROYED and DECIMATED ***EVERYTHING*** That Fear was supposed to stand for.

People used to complain ""WhErE is The FeAr In fEaR"" (and me answering that)... but that question is FAR MORE apparent now than it EVER was than. What the FUCK are we supposed to ***FEAR*** right now?!?!

Because the ONLY thing I fear on FTWD right now, is bad writing and walkie talkies.

Rebooting the show was a TERRIBLE mistake. And Crossing Morgan over was an even worse one.

Fear was ALWAYS intended to be on its own. (Despite Gimple saying it's ""always been planned"" but we all know he speaks out of his ass because he's a god-damn fucking dumbass.) People complained that ""THe wAlkER's wEreN't sCArY"" so ""WhErE iS tHe FeAr In FeAr ThE wAlkIng DeAd"" because I guess they missed the point of the name. (Remeber Rick Grime's speech? It's ripped straight from the comics. ""We ARE the Walking Dead."" and that same speech applies here. The show was NEVER about the zombies (despite being the main reason most people watch it.) Kirkman himself has stated that the zombies are just a backdrop. The story is about the survivors. How a post-apocalyptic world can change a man. How They're pretty much dead already because no matter what... *they're all infected.* Even if they're alive. They're not. They ARE *The Walking Dead.*

That same logic applied here. See, Dave Erickson had referenced Breaking Bad as one of his main sources of inspiration for this show. What was Breaking Bad's purpose? *To break a man. To turn a man from Mr. Chips to a cold-blooded killer.* What was Fear's intention? *To turn an ordinary family into a group of morally grey villains. To turn Madison into Negan. The Governor.* Madison wasn't designed to be any other villain. She was intended to be a villain to everyone else, but more importantly her family. She was her **families** villain. *She was* ***Nick's*** *villain.* This was a slow-burn. We had to see how these people got there. It's not as easy as Fear NOW likes to make it (Oh No MY HUsBanD Died And No oNe woUld HelP Him, Now Ima  FIltHy villain."" or ""My TrUck ran Out Of GAs so NoW i'M a BaD GuY"" What the FUCK kind of logic is THAT bullshit???) We had to see these characters develop. Rise to power. See what in the apocalypse FORCES THEM down this Path. People didn't like the slow burn character-study that Fear was intended to be. They wanted non-stop action-packed, long-winded speeches and unnecessary powerful Walker herds like Gimple made SOO prominent on The Walking Dead. Fear tried to be what TWD was always intended to be while incorporating people *breaking bad* (Hailing from Virginia as far back as 1919, means to raise hell and break a person.)

Fear season 1 and 2 had some really great moments. Some really great characters. (I even liked Chris. Don't @ me.) Sure, the writing wasn't anything too special. But it wasn't *bad* by any means. (Except that one line in 1x01 ""Boom! Killshot bitch!"" Yeah sorry... no teenagers talked like that. Not even in 2010.) And if you binge the seasons, S2 is probably the CLOSEST we got to the non-stop action that plagued TWD (Before S4+5...)

Than... season 3 came along. All of the characters past actions came to a head as you FINALLY begin to understand what these characters were doing. Why they were doing. What made them do it. You found yourself questioning these people and asking... ""Are they the good guys?"" Madison was a manipulative, scheming, bitch. She was ALWAYS intended to be this way. It wasn't bad acting or bad writing. And people finally began to understand this. People finally began to understand what the word *Fear* meant in fear The Walking Dead. *We were supposed to Fear Madison and her family (we ARE The Walking dead).* Fear season 3 came equipped with an (almost) entirely new writing team (Save for a few select people) but with Erickson still at the helm.

2 years of build-up. 2 seasons of constant shit from fans to FINALLY get to season 3. The season where Erickson could FINALLY begin to cross the ""Morally grey"" side into ""Oh shit, these guys are fucking insane... I don't think these are the god guys..."" Before AMC decided to anally fuck him with a large metal rod.

Because of the backlash Fear got in the first 2 seasons, they gave Erickson ONE more season to tell his story to ""move him onto other AMC properties"" (Which is fancy for ""FIRED!"") and they began to look for the cheapest people on the market that could be their Yes Man like Gimple, while they give them under the table blowjobs.

AMC was NOT expecting the praise season 3 got and even LESS expecting of the Madison fandom building up. But they didn't care. They thought people still wanted to see TWD.

Erickson closes out his season with a bang. Only leaving ONE character fate confirmed and leaving EVERYONE ELSE open-ended, as Madison was the MOST IMPORTANT character to Fear. In his opinion. ***You know, THE SHOW'S GOD DAMN FUCKING CREATOR!***

And now... that leaves us here. October of 2017, Announcing that ""Worlds collide"" (When it really should have said ""COMPLETE TAKEOVER"") BEFORE Erickson's season EVEN FINISHED AIRING. That's how egotistical and Greedy AMC was.

And here we are. 2018. The year Fear changed.... forever.

# Fear seasons 4+5 and the crossover

Starting with a HUGE time jump, Fear season 4 opens up roughly 2 years after the dam exploded, with a new character (Who seemed promising at first)  who meets Morgan Jones. A character who, much like John Dorie, was once a promising character, now reduced to nothing more but a [2D closed-loop character](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/cn36he/morgan_stopped_being_interesting/) who, Gimple's idea of character development is making him switch between ""All life is precious"" and ""CLEAR!"" (Oh yeah, great fucking writing Gimple.)

Fear was changing... rapidly. clearly. And it wasn't for the better.

What fans Fear did have, were left confused, puzzled, and angered at the fact they the story they stuck through, for better and worse, was left in the dust. Only passing responses to fill in a plot-hole these writers didn't want to explain or build upon.

AMC Made Fear a carbon-copy of The Walking Dead. Changing all the characters personalities to better fit their writing style (Which is fairytales and shitty fanfiction.) They removed the MEANING of the word Fear, and only kept it to pass it off as the same show. even though it's very... clearly... disastrously not.

AMC only catered to ONE side of the fandom, and that was TWD side. They didn't cater to those who ONLY liked fear and didn't like the flagship (For all the reasons I stated in the last heading). they didn't cater to those who have been watching this show for 3 YEARS. They only catered to those who liked TWD. When they COULD HAVE ***AND SHOULD HAVE*** catered to BOTH sides of the parties. It's NOT impossible to blend the two. It's not impossible to make Fear a show that stands on its own and follows these characters down a villainous path, while still giving the new fans they tried to bring over that sweet TWD juice they like so much (despite being flat and watered down now from Gimple's era.) Hell, crossing Abraham over for HALF A SEASON still blends the 2 nicely. I'm doing it. Dozens of others HAVE done it. If AMC truly gave a shit about the OG fandom and STILL wanted to draw in kore viewers, Abraham made more sense. But why go with logic when we can go with filthy ladies and hot air beer balloons!

Fear, a show that took PRIDE in being a nearly STANDALONE entity (Only taking PLACE in the same universe as TWD), was now reduced to a show where they could promote the main show. Makes perfect fucking sense.

Crossing Morgan over, CHANGING THE KEY FUNDAMENTALS OF WHAT MADE FEAR... ***FEAR,*** KILLING THE ***ONE CHARACTER***  DAVE CONFIRMED ALIVE BECAUSE HE (THE SHOWS ***FUCKING CREATOR FOR FUCKS SAKE)*** THOUGHT SHE WAS IMPORTANT! And... AMC gave Morgan the lead. Morgan. A man who was NEVER ON FEAR, to begin with. WHO WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO APPEAR ON FEAR... the fucking lead. [Opposed to an ACTUAL FUCKING OG!](https://www.reddit.com/r/FearTheWalkingDead/comments/d6akl4/making_morgan_the_lead_on_fear_in_s4_was_fucked_up/) (That's like making Alden the lead after Rick's death, opposed to the fucking OG's.

Crossing Morgan over, DESTROYED and DECIMATED ***EVERYTHING*** That Fear was supposed to stand for.

People used to complain ""WhErE is The FeAr In fEaR"" (and me answering that)... but that question is FAR MORE apparent now than it EVER was than. What the FUCK are we supposed to ***FEAR*** right now?!?!

Because the ONLY thing I fear on FTWD right now, is bad writing and walkie talkies.

Rebooting the show was a TERRIBLE mistake. And Crossing Morgan over was an even worse one.

***YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS!***"

Hear me out 9X05 theory,"So im watching with subtitles and just noticed that right after the bridge scene it pans to Jadis who is messing with the frequency of her walkie talkie and picks up a conversation of two men talking

Man 1: what was that? Was that the bridge?
Man 2: Rick! He blew it to stop the herd!

Then she adjusts the frequency more and you hear a woman say ‚Äúmove north, break up the rest. Bring some guns‚Äù.

Immediately after she sees the helicopter and speaks into her walkie talkie without changing the channel or frequency and gets an immediate response from the helicopter group.

Is it implied that the first two men talking and the woman were both others members of our known communities with walkies? In that case wouldnt they two men and the woman be on the same Chanel already?Wouldn't they be on the same channel and Jadis wouldnt need to adjust the frequency twice to speak to any other member of the communities? If not, she would definitely need to change the channel or frequency to talk to the helicopter group and not just leave it on the one where she heard the womans voice right?

What I would like to know is how long would it take before the world starts to return to its ‚Äúnormal‚Äù state? As in, back to the state it was before the apocalypse. 

Would it take decades to centuries before the world starts gaining population and establishing governments again? Or even beginning to advance in technology again? Would it even be able to return at all?

S10 Oficial Main Characters Descriptions (Series Regulars) - AMC,"**- Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus):** *Although a lone wolf at heart, Daryl is loyal beyond measure. Watching Carol struggle with her grief and anger causes Daryl great concern while his sense of duty to the communities is heightened with the rules imposed by the Whisperers. He inherently understands everyone has done, and has to continue to do, horrible things to survive. Daryl‚Äôs insight of knowing when to evade or attack, observe or act, listen or command illustrates not only his fighting style, but his strength of character as well. How will Daryl‚Äôs wisdom serve him and those around him? Will the walls begin to close in, making him once again feel trapped and claustrophobic? Will he revert to his caged animal approach to survival? Or will he accept this new normal and perhaps start living beyond today?* 

**- Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride):** *Carol continues to be devastated by the death of her son Henry. Haunted by loss and to further guard herself, Carol left her husband Ezekiel. She is in a push/pull state of wanting to separate from everyone and everything, and seeking revenge on the mother that took her child. What is she capable of doing in order to erase the events of her past? What more is she willing to leave behind and how might her actions affect the ones she loves?* 

**- Michonne (Danai Gurira):** *Michonne continues to be the strong strategic thinker she has been since before the post-apocalyptic world. Her pendulum has swung from staunchly independent to a pessimistic protector to having faith in humanity, but always squarely grounded in what is for the greater good and safety of her family and the communities. Michonne innately knows Alpha has all the power and that they must abide by her rules, for now, because revenge will get everyone killed. Michonne wants to dismantle Alpha‚Äôs power. She is teaching Judith how to strategically attack an enemy. She must equip her daughter and her son for their future in this dead world.* 

**- Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt):** *Still in love with Rosita, Eugene is once again the odd man out in vying for her affection and attention behind Gabriel, with whom she is in a relationship, and Siddiq, the father of her child. Eugene is lonely and wants to be in a relationship. He analyzes his actions with Rosita with the same vigor he problem solves for the communities. Both involve many people with different opinions. Both are life and death. His decisions could severely alter everyone‚Äôs way of life.* 

**- Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos):** *Rosita has given birth to a baby girl named Socorro (aka Coco), which means ‚Äúhelp.‚Äù And nothing could ring more true for Rosita. She is learning it takes a village to raise a child. Rosita is trying to find the balance between being a vigilant soldier, a responsibility in which she is skilled and confident; and adjusting to being a new mom, an unfamiliar and unknown role.* 

**- Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam):** *Gabriel is in a position of power he has not been in since the world and his parish fell. He trusts himself and the communities trust him. He believes in the charter and he holds great hope for the future of the joined communities. He is in a relationship with Rosita and is navigating the parental waters with Siddiq and Eugene. As Alpha tightens her hold, Gabriel‚Äôs compassion is tested and his moral compass challenged.* 

**- Aaron (Ross Marquand):** *Aaron has not healed from the loss of Jesus and the tragic events of the fair. He will not let his guard down again. He has become a strong leader and no longer has the talk first mentality. Raising Gracie has filled him with purpose and fight as he trains the militia to protect their communities. He realizes there is no right or wrong in this world, just protecting your loved ones at whatever the cost. His survivor‚Äôs guilt now has an outlet for release.* 

**- Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan):** *Negan is coming to terms with his post-Sanctuary life. He has been granted some small freedoms, but struggles to find his place within the community, particularly when the increasing threat of the Whisperers causes paranoia and suspicion to seep in. Negan wants to lay low and not become the focus of anyone‚Äôs rage, but what is a bad guy to do when he isn‚Äôt allowed to be good? Will he find redemption? Regardless of the situation, whether he has the upper hand or not, Negan is always ruthlessly vocal and honest.* 

**- Ezekiel (Khary Payton):** *Ezekiel is a former shadow of himself, having lost his family and the Kingdom. Everything he has built is gone. He has let go of the pretense and presence of being King. He is unsure of his purpose and does not know if he will find hope again. His community is unraveling and looking towards him for help, but is this a weight too great to bear?* 

**- Jerry (Cooper Andrews):** *Ezekiel wasn't the only one who lost the Kingdom, Jerry lost it too. Now Jerry is trying to hold on to Ezekiel, who is disappearing within himself. Without the King, Jerry tries to remain positive, hoping to create a new home at Hilltop for his family and the others displaced from the Kingdom. There is no doubt, Jerry wants his leader to return.* 

**- Siddiq (Avi Nash):** *As the sole survivor of Alpha‚Äôs wrath last year, Siddiq is suffering from PTSD. He is privately trying to piece back together his sanity while tending to his newborn and the increasing medical needs for Alexandria. Faced with a memory that never ends, he questions what is happening around him, inching further down the rabbit hole of depression and anxiety.* 

**- Alden (Callan McAuliffe):** *Alden is on a mission to avenge Enid‚Äôs death by attempting to fortify the communities with an impenetrable defense. Knowing defense is only one aspect of an attack, Alden is reactive and proactive in his thinking.* 

**- Magna (Nadia Hilker):** *Magna does not like what she is seeing and she certainly does not like the Whisperers imposed rules. Her gut instinct is to take care of herself and her immediate loved ones first and foremost, even at the expense of others within the communities.* 

**- Yumiko (Eleanor Matsuura):** *Yumiko respects and upholds the wartime rules the communities have in place to protect themselves from the Whisperers. As tensions rise, Yumiko‚Äôs inner circle expands as she aims to protect the communities. She finally has a home and will fight to protect it and everyone in it, but her approach proves to be more complicated than she images.* 

**- Connie (Lauren Ridloff):** *Connie is a stealth fighter and remains ever dedicated to protecting her sister. She is open to accepting a new way of life and building friendships within the communities, but her focus on the Whisperers does not leave room for much else. Does she have tunnel vision in her mission or is it an excuse for her to distance herself from an expanded life.* 

**- Judith Grimes (Cailey Fleming):** *A kid warrior beyond her years, Judith is every bit Michonne‚Äôs daughter from the way she handles her sword to the way she handles people. She is also her brothers‚Äô keeper, approaching the future with Carl‚Äôs wisdom and RJ by her side. Rick, too, is a part of her daily life as she shares her version of stories she‚Äôs heard to keep his memory alive. Her history is never forgotten. She embodies the past, present, and future. Will she have to grow up too soon or will she be able to remain a kid for a little while longer?* 

**- Alpha (Samantha Morton):** *Alpha is playing the long game for keeps. Her reign of terror is calculated. Worst of all, she has the patience to see it through to the end, and the horde to back it up. You cannot question or escape what she is going to do. She believes primal instincts are the only way of survival and must prove the communities‚Äô humanity of the past has no use in this world. She is calm and steady, as a leader should be, to keep her flock in line.* 

**- Lydia (Cassady McClincy):** *Not her mother‚Äôs daughter, Lydia tries hard to assimilate into her newfound community. Like Negan, she feels she will never be accepted without questioning eyes upon her. Like Daryl, she is trying to unlearn her neglected animalistic upbringing. Will she find her voice as she traverses life between these two ways of survival?* 

**- Beta (Ryan Hurst):** *Beta is a Whisperer to his core, perhaps even more so than Alpha. Meeting Alpha in the post-apocalyptic world gave Beta an identity and a way to survive he never could have imagined without her. As Alpha‚Äôs unwavering right-hand man, all he does is in her name.*",1,"S10 Oficial Main Characters Descriptions (Series Regulars) - AMC **- Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus):** *Although a lone wolf at heart, Daryl is loyal beyond measure.

Little things you would have changed about certain storylines,"By little things, I mean the major events and crucial plot points remain largely the same, but with a small change that would have made them resonate better in your view.

For instance, I think that Andrea, not Daryl, should have been the one to put down Dale. Daryl doing it really isn't crucial. Daryl gains nothing from it as a character besides Rick thanking him for doing it in his place, and didn't really have a relationship with Dale. Andrea meanwhile, not only had the most interaction with Dale than anyone else, but her taking the shot would be a cruel and tragic irony as their initial storyline of the season was Dale trying to keep Andrea away from her gun, afraid she would use it on herself to end her pain. Instead, she ends up using it on him to end his pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the fallout of Rick's decision to exile Carol should have resulted in much more of an angry outburst from Daryl, resurfacing some Season 1 Daryl traits. Considering their location, it would have been a good time for a more heated confrontation that mirrored the Rick/Tyreese fight of the comics, which also heavily involved Carol. I definitely don't think it should have gone as far as that did, but at the very least, I'd start the scene off with Rick staggering against the railing from a punch and an enraged Daryl grabbing his collar. Rick shoves him back into the bars behind him. Daryl advances on him but doesn't hit again, the two glaring at each other. Rick angrily whispers, ""She killed two of our own, she couldn't be here"". The rest of the scene plays out as it did, except with Daryl pointing out that Rick is forgetting he could have killed one of their own if he hadn't stopped him, referencing Tyreese. Daryl storms off at the end of the scene, and Rick goes to tell Tyreese the truth on his own. The point of this is that Rick and Daryl don't speak to each other again until the finale, and when they do, their logic has reversed, with Rick realizing that the brutality is a part of him, bringing up what he did to Tyreese specifically, while Daryl tries to convince him that it's not. It would add a little bit more to that final understanding, and again create more of a connection to past events of the season.

&amp;#x200B;

Also in ""Too Far Gone"", I think some of the Governor's militia should have gotten inside the prison like in the comics, making it clearer why the prison is lost for the group. However, I envision them entering a cell block, perhaps running from zombies pursuing them and shutting the doors behind them, and then the camera pans up and reveals that they are inside Cell Block A, the infected block (perhaps with some zombies of patients who died during the battle without adequate care), implying that their victory will be short lived and that the illness is waiting for them. The only real change it'd cause during Glenn's wandering of the interior of the prison is some commotion he can hear from block A, but he never goes in there.

I think that the fallout of Rick's decision to exile Carol should have resulted in much more of an angry outburst from Daryl, resurfacing some Season 1 Daryl traits. Considering their location, it would have been a good time for a more heated confrontation that mirrored the Rick/Tyreese fight of the comics, which also heavily involved Carol. I definitely don't think it should have gone as far as that did, but at the very least, I'd start the scene off with Rick staggering against the railing from a punch and an enraged Daryl grabbing his collar. Rick shoves him back into the bars behind him. Daryl advances on him but doesn't hit again, the two glaring at each other. Rick angrily whispers, ""She killed two of our own, she couldn't be here"". The rest of the scene plays out as it did, except with Daryl pointing out that Rick is forgetting he could have killed one of their own if he hadn't stopped him, referencing Tyreese. Daryl storms off at the end of the scene, and Rick goes to tell Tyreese the truth on his own. The point of this is that Rick and Daryl don't speak to each other again until the finale, and when they do, their logic has reversed, with Rick realizing that the brutality is a part of him, bringing up what he did to Tyreese specifically, while Daryl tries to convince him that it's not. It would add a little bit more to that final understanding, and again create more of a connection to past events of the season.

&amp;#x200B;

Also in ""Too Far Gone"", I think some of the Governor's militia should have gotten inside the prison like in the comics, making it clearer why the prison is lost for the group. However, I envision them entering a cell block, perhaps running from zombies pursuing them and shutting the doors behind them, and then the camera pans up and reveals that they are inside Cell Block A, the infected block (perhaps with some zombies of patients who died during the battle without adequate care), implying that their victory will be short lived and that the illness is waiting for them. The only real change it'd cause during Glenn's wandering of the interior of the prison is some commotion he can hear from block A, but he never goes in there.

&amp;#x200B;

What about you guys? What moments, be they good or bad in your view, would you tweak slightly to make a more effective scene or thematic connection?"

Rewriting S8,"The popular opinion I've seen is that S1-5 of TWD were great, S6 was the beginning of the end of the show many loved, and S7 and S8 resulted in many people quitting. S8 especially, with the controversy during it. 

In this post I want to start a discussion on how you would've changed S8, and by extension S7 with how they are both two parts of a larger story. 

Most of the changes I would make pertain mostly to S8, though there are a few I would make to S7, with the most important being: 

*Blended episodes in 7A. This is something many people complained about. 

*Establish that Negan has a soft spot for kids. This was [somewhat] done in the show, but I would've upped it up. Make his relationship with Carl genuine. Have him view him like a son he never had. In the show, I felt like Negan only wanted Carl to be a lieutenant of his and nothing more. Furthermore, establish that Negan hates violence towards children.

*Establish more of a relationship between Negan and Simon. Show more scenes with them interacting. 

*Make Oceanside smaller and not just women and children. In the canon they were maybe 60-80 strong but in my rewrite they're maybe 30-40 strong.

*I'm split on this one, but I had an idea of Sasha not killing herself and instead attacking Negan on her own volition. 

*Instead of Negan being ready to kill Carl, he instead reveals to Rick what he said in 8x16 about the lineup and prepares to kill Rick instead. 

And that's about it. The rest of the changes I would make pertain to S8. 

Now, regarding 8x01, I'm not sure about what I would change. I didn't like how Negan fell down the stairs, though I can't think of another way to keep him busy for a few episodes, so he can make his attack in 8x08. 
There's not much I would change with the next few episodes, aside from getting rid of that nerdy looking Savior and letting Alvaro live. 

In 8x06, Carl finds Siddiq and does what he did, except he doesn't get bit. I hated the way Carl did on the show. 

In 8x08, Dwight helps Eugene, Dr. Carson and Father Gabriel escape where they regroup with the remaining survivors. Enid doesn't kill Natania.

In 8x09, Gavin is spared instead of killed and defects to the survivors' side. Since Carl isn't dying at this point, Rick, Michonne and him go with the remaining survivors to the hilltop. Dwight still goes his own way from the group to throw off the Saviors. 

In 8x12, I would remove the whole encounter with Georgie's group and instead have Eugene begin drafting a list of things for them to do after the war. Perhaps he gets a few people to go on a run with him to raid a library of useful books. 
In my rewrite, Rick doesn't go after Negan's convoy. Instead, Simon makes Negan crash and tries to kill him. Walkers get in the way and Negan's fate is left unknown to Simon. Simon makes it look like a massive tragedy before rallying everyone to **expunge** the Hilltop. 

8x13 is where I make some major changes. A smaller one is that Alvaro dies in this episode to the tainted weapons. 
The biggest one I have is that Rick goes after Simon engages him in a fist fight. I imagine him defending the Hilltop with Carl before leaving him on his own to go fight Simon, telling him that he's a man now. 

Rick is fighting Simon but is having a hard time. Carl notices and goes to aid his father. Simon pushes Rick back and takes on Carl. He stabs him right in the chest and walks away, no fucks given. He walks away with the confidence that Rick will tend to his injured son over attacking him. And he's right. 

Carl dies a quick but painful death. No final words. No plea for Rick to be peaceful. Rick is in too much shock to say anything. I just picture him holding Carl as he's bleeding out profusely. 
Rick drops onto his back next to his deceased son and lies there for the rest of the battle. Daryl finds him afterwards and is in complete shock. Survivors who were with Carl for a long time (Michonne, Carol, Maggie, etc.) are devastated. I don't know who puts Carl down, but I imagine it being Daryl or Michonne. 
After Carl is put down, Rick gets up to help to pick up his body, where Maggie offers to help him (similarly to 7x01, where Rick helped her carry Glenn's body). Rick, Maggie, Daryl, Carol and 

Michonne make a quick trip to Alexandria to bury him. 
Rick gets a Savior radio and demands to speak to Negan. Instead, he gets Arat, who tells him Negan is absent. 

The stuff with the prisoners goes mostly the same. 

In the beginning of 8x15, Negan gets to the Sanctuary with Laura (whose presence he keeps a secret). The first thing he does is talk to Rick over the radio, where he learns about Carl's death. Rick tells him who did it, and Negan explains that he doesn't approve of what happened and that he will make things right. Rick tells Negan that nothing will make Carl's death right and slams the radio on the ground before smashing it. 

Negan gathers up his loyal members and learns from Dwight that Simon is rallying up people against him. 

Daryl, Rosita, Eugene, and others attack the bullet factory place where they begin manufacturing their own. 

Negan confronts Simon in front of everyone. Both sides pull guns on each other, but the leaders of both parties order their people to let them settle it on their own. 

Negan confronts Simon about the Scavengers. He confronts him about trying to kill him and leaving him to die. He confronts him about the Hilltop. And he confronts him about killing Carl, a kid. The two break out into a fist fight. 

Negan overpowers Simon and kills him. He cuts his head off and orders for Simon's followers to be executed. They're hung up as walker guards. Simon's head, on the other hand, is sent to the Hilltop along with a handwritten letter from Negan to Rick. 

Michonne gives Rick the letter. He reads it, in which he learns about what Negan did: He killed his own right-hand man, someone he valued so much, because he ultimately believed in justice. He offers Rick to meet up within the next few days to negotiate. 

Dwight is caught and is imprisoned like he was in the canon. Negan states that he will execute bring him with him to talk with Rick, after which he will be killed. 

Rick is not in the mood for negotiating. An assault is launched on the Sanctuary again. Aaron manages to get Oceanside to fight with them. The four communities proceed to make their way to the Sanctuary, but a guard spots them and informs Negan. The remaining Saviors go out and engage the survivors. 
People on both sides die. Natania and Regina are both killed in the combat. 

Rick gets Negan alone and takes him on. Despite what he did, Rick still wants to kill him. He wounds Negan and gets him on his knees. He's about to kill Negan, but he takes a second to think about what has happened. Negan avenged his own son and killed his right-hand man in the process. Rick has a change of heart and holds his hand out to Negan. 

As Negan is wounded, Rick helps him walk back to the survivors. Rick threatens to kill Negan if he tries anything. Negan eventually collapses from exhaustion and Rick orders Siddiq to save him. 

Cyndie becomes the new leader of Oceanside. Rick, Maggie and Ezekiel make a visit to the Sanctuary where they endorse Gavin as he steps up as the new leader of the Saviors. 

Eugene gathers the five leaders of the communities, along with important people from each of them and proposes a council. Basically, every community does its own thing, but when something happens that affects everyone, the five leaders are to form a council and vote on the matter. There is a unanimous agreement. Eugene and the others begin drafting a list of rules. 

Morgan leaves and tells Jadis, or rather Anne, that she can go live at Alexandria. She gladly accepts. Daryl confronts Dwight and tells him that he forgives him, but they're not friends and that he doesn't want Dwight talking to him unless it's something important. Dwight accepts this and tells him ""You won't be seeing me for a while.""

Dwight goes to Rick and tells him about how Sherry is still out there and that he is unable to rest with her fate unknown. He announces that he'll be leaving. Rick goes out with him to help get him a car and some supplies for his journey. Before they part ways, Dwight thanks Rick for trusting him and giving him the opportunity to make a change, and to take down the man they both despised. 

Rick goes to Negan's cell where they have a talk. Negan asks Rick about his decision to let him live. Rick admits that Negan is not the man he taught he was, and that he's thankful that he avenged his son. Negan tries to manipulate Rick by saying something along the lines of ""Let me out and I'll prove you even more wrong,"" to which Rick tells him not to push his luck.

The final scene of my rewrite involves Rick sitting underneath a tree and thinking about everything that has happened. He begins to cry. 8x16 ends on a hopeful note that the communities will finally achieve something similar to how life was before the outbreak.

Who else will stop watching once rick is gone,"I've been thinking about how when rick leaves the show, i will definitley stop watching. I don't know if I will ever come back to it, but I will certainly stop after his last episode. I always thought (before the rumors came about) that if Rick dies i will stop watching out of respect for the show and because i dont see how this show can carry on without its leading force.

I just know that when rick has his final episode, this will be the episode where it all ends to me.

SYNOPSIS FOR THE FIRST TWO EPISODES OF SEASON 9 FROM AMC(NO SPOILERS),[removed],1,SYNOPSIS FOR THE FIRST TWO EPISODES OF SEASON 9 FROM AMC(NO SPOILERS) [removed]
Rick Grimes Exit Theory,I think that a way Rick grimes could leave the show that would please both people who want him to die and those that just want him to leave would be that he gets gravely injured (Not bit just seriously injured) and they discover that the bridge they have built or something else is being threatened by a herd of walkers and Rick realizes that if they get through they will destroy the community they have built both physically and symbolically. Realizing that he is mortally wounded and not willing to let anything compromise the new world they have made Rick decides to stop the herd himself. Ricks last episode would be very emotional and focused on his journey and goodbyes with everyone and ending with him confronting the herd in some way that manages to save everyone but also make it look like Rick sacrificed himself for the greater good. The key here is that it makes it seem very clear that Rick is killed but not completely certain and is not showed explicitly making it possible for him to somehow have survived and come back in the future but also works if he never comes back and is just forever thought of as a hero who died to save everyone. I also think the second time jump will focus on how life has moved on without Rick and there will be monuments to him like a statue or something. ,1,Rick Grimes Exit Theory I think that a way Rick grimes could leave the show that would please both people who want him to die and those that just want him to leave would be that he gets gravely injured (Not bit just seriously injured) and they discover that the bridge they have built or something else is being threatened by a herd of walkers and Rick realizes that if they get through they will destroy the community they have built both physically and symbolically.

Just finished season 8. I‚Äôm really disappointed.,"The part that I didn‚Äôt like the most was Maggie, Daryl, and Jesus‚Äô future plotting against Rick and Michonne. I totally get why Maggie is angry, but after all the things they have been through, they can‚Äôt even have a civil discussion? After all that talk of trusting no one outside their circle, they decide to backstab each other? The real part that pissed me off was Daryl agreeing with Maggie. Daryl was always an upfront person, he shot straight from the hip and always kept it real. It just seemed out of character for him. I can‚Äôt think of a time when Rick did something wrong and Daryl didn‚Äôt immediately say something about it. Now they are just gonna stab him in the back?",1,"Just finished season 8.

Showerthought about zombie babies,"Somewhere in TWD universe there‚Äôs a hospital. Inside that hospital is a maternity ward. In the ward, a nursery.  The staff and patients all died/fled early on like the hospital we saw in season 1 episode 1....

The fleeing staff were too overwhelmed or afraid and fled without taking the newborn infants. They couldn‚Äôt, there was no way to take a dozen or more infants, all screaming and needing to be bottle fed every few hours, when the world was falling apart around them and people dying like flies.

So somewhere, in that hospital, there‚Äôs that room.  Dozens of zombie babies in their little clear plastic bassinets. They all died and turned, but can‚Äôt get out. They lie there groaning shrilly in their infant zombie voices... forever. 

...this image has haunted me ever some Jenner told us that everyone is infected back in season 1.  Also I‚Äôve always been irked by the notable lack of walker kids in the show. I get that most kids would be eaten and not leave corpses but surely there would be more than just the bare handful we‚Äôve seen throughout the show so far.

Binge Watched S8 And it was awesome.,"I dont get all the hate. Even upto 7A it was good. It only got bad at 7B. So I stopped watching for a while and binge watched s8 entirely and it was freaking good?

I thought the gun fights were pretty exciting even the rick vs negan moments. 

Walker moments were awesome as well.

Character development was great some people could have had it better.

Thought Rick and Daryl both were being too much of a cunt at times specially giving the word and killing saviours.

And I dont get why people hate Negan? I thought he made the show extremely intriguing to watch haha. I get this Jadis encounter was stupid and all how he got the flares/guns while being tied down and all. 

I also get sometimes the extreme accuracy of hitting fodder for ricks gang while simultaneously missing important villains may piss off people but it happens in every series?

FTWD S4 essentially repeats the story and structure of TWD S4,"* The first part of the season focuses on the home that the group has. They're building it up and everybody seems pretty happy and content to be settled down.
* At some point, the community is weakened by some force.
* Some asshole(s) decide they want to take over / loot our group's home and decides to attack.
* The community is lost and our characters are scattered.
* We get some bottle episodes to focus on character development.
* Several new characters are introduced and join one of the small groups.
* A new force is introduced and threatens our group (i.e. the Claimers and Martha).
* By the end of the season, the group has come together.
* I predict that Martha will die in the finale, meaning that both external forces are dealt with by the end of the season.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I've felt like FTWD S4 was a discount TWD S4 this entire time. It lacks direction and focus. Nothing makes sense. We lost two of the three characters that actually mattered on this show. Half the characters are unbearable or make no sense at all (i.e. Martha and, to some degree, Morgan). Characters that should be used are not used as much (i.e. Morgan and John). Half of the cast is new and, so far, not really lovable. The first 3 seasons feel almost pointless now, since we only have a couple remaining characters from then. I felt so hopeful at the start of this season, but it has only ended in disappointment. I honestly feel like watching FTWD S4 was like rewatching a lesser version TWD S4.

[SPOILERS] Eugene's end game,"I think Eugene's ruse was brilliant and well-executed.  He plays the part of an arrogant post-doc research-grant-baby sycophant to absolute perfection and he is utterly convincing.  He isn't the stereotypical near-sighted, suck-up bookworm ""nerd"" like Milton (The Govenor's Milton, not *Paradise Lost* Milton, who now that I think of it was also a nearsighted, suck-up bookworm nerd).   Eugene is much more convincing as a professional scientist and while everybody doubts his courage and strength, nobody doubts his story.  

So I never really understood why Eugene confesses to the group that the entire ""let's save the world in Washington"" quest is just a hoax to get them to protect him along the way.  Eugene is smart enough to know there's likely nothing left in D.C., almost certainly no infrastructure.  If they made it all the way to the city, Eugene can simply try to access one of the government plazas, make a few half-hearted attempts to raise someone, then declare it hopeless and eventually move on.  I doubt Rick or Abraham would risk their lives to try accessing an inaccessible and likely abandoned laboratory.  And if it turns out the government is up and running and they can somehow verify Eugene's story, it seems likely they'd have bigger things to think about at that point.  

Why does he confess?  Why not just carry-on with the ruse and cross that bridge when you get to it?  People talk about Eugene's lack of an endgame but to me it seems pretty basic to me that he would had a perfect plan if he just carried it out to its logical conclusion.

[Show spoiler] [Comic spoiler] Rick theory/shitpost,"They're advertising the start of this season as ""The final episodes of Rick"". This is a massive comic spoiler. Go with me here. At the start of season 9 were gonna be 3+ years in the show. Then after Rick leaves, there is going to be another 5ish year skip. That's nearly twice the time they've went through currently. And think about all that's changed with our characters in that time. They've all developed so much.

So, here's my theory/shitpost. Rick's original death will be open ended. We won't know. Insert time skip. Whisperers are coming. Everyone's met them. You have alpha and beta doing their thing. Then we all slowly notice something. It's never certain, but we can just tell. Beta has the same body and build as Rick. He tilts his head all the time. And we all figure it out at the same time. He calls out to one of his whisperer friends. Coincidentally their name is caaaarl. Then everyone understand why beta(rark) doesn't want to take off his face mask. It's Rick grimes! The comic readers will understand why the clever advertising of ""the final episodes of rick"" is such a spoiler. Beta says ""he has no name"" in the comics. Rick is dead, but has become beta. Then all of season 10 is rick's story in between to show him becoming beta.

In Regards to Rick/Andrew Lincoln,"So the news has been out for a couple months now, [Andrew Lincoln is leaving The Walking Dead](https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/29/walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-exit/) sometime during Season 9. 

While this is a sad thing to say the least as Rick IS The Walking Dead, we must keep this a civil place to discuss The Walking Dead.

AMC has launched a huge advertisement effort into Rick's departure from the show, from weekly tweets like [this](https://twitter.com/WalkingDead_AMC/status/1044674146981089280) to commercials counting down the days till ""Rick's last episodes."" It would be hard to censor the conversation surrounding that. So with that being said 
##Rick leaving the show will not be considered a spoiler this upcoming season#

but future spoiler rules do still apply. If The Spoiling Dead announces how Rick dies/leaves and you talk about it without the proper tags than that will be considered a spoiler.

&gt; ""His very last scene, he's laying there, and he's supposed to giggle,""

assuming this means the last chronological scene, but that could be wrong since apparently Chandler's last scene was the one with Judith and his last was filmed first

the fact that in one scene, possibly his actual last, he's ""laying there"" makes me think [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVlwj05R9Jo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=79) is the same as [the one](https://youtu.be/tVlwj05R9Jo?t=239) 4 minutes in. The second one we know is Rick, which if *someone* is laying down, who else would be laying down earlier in that trailer?

so i guess that confirms he actually dies and doesn't just leave? don't know why he'd be giggling. as weird as it sounds, maybe just taking light of what he's created for everyone while being devoured. kind of like his smile when they were cornered by the junkyard people. maybe he gets bit first when redirecting that herd and the point of laying there's just because he knows he's at his end like carl in s8's msp? maybe he dies before that 1:20 frame? but at the same time, i don't think anyone would let that happen to him, with retrieving glenn's body, abraham's and carl's",1,"[FUTURE SPOILERS] how rick leaves the show? https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/2018/09/28/the-walking-dead-rick-last-episode-norman-reedus/

NEW RICK SEASON 9 TEASER,[removed],1,NEW RICK SEASON 9 TEASER [removed]
Which character got the dumbest death in the TV series?,"There are several to choose from:

Carl - knocked down and bitten by ONE walker, later shot himself after writing a love letter to Negan.

Shiva - a fully grown, healthy tiger was surrounded by seven weak zombies and brought down.

Eastman - stopped Morgan from getting bit by pushing him out of the way and TURNING HIS BACK to the zombie, getting a bite. Died from the infection.

Andrea - spent her time having a nice chat with a dying Milton instead of trying to get the wrench to free herself. Got bitten and killed herself afterwards.

Beth - stabbed Dawn with a pair of scissors in the shoulderblade, gets her brains blown out by accident.

Carter - while running through the woods, a single zombie grabs him through a couple trees. Carter just stands there and draws his face closer to the zombie, getting a chunk of flesh torn out.

Tina - kneels over a couple of corpses with flowers. The corpses wake up and Tina stands up and starts screaming. She turns around, lays down next to them, still screaming, and gets eaten.

Gavin - runs away and gets cornered by Ezekiel, Morgan and Carol. M and C have a philosophical debate, and out of nowhere Henry shows up and impales Gavin with a stick.

Morales - comes back for no reason at all 8 seasons later to monologue at Rick and gets ambushed by Daryl who shoots an arrow through his skull.

Deanna - gets bitten and is brought up to a room to lay on a bed. Rick, Jessie and the rest cover themselves with zombie guts and leave the house. Deanna is left alone in a house full of zombies. She stands up, pulls the door wide open, and shoots some of them. Then she just stands there and screams before she gets eaten.",1,"Which character got the dumbest death in the TV series?

What are the chances???,"That Angela Kang will wrap up the whisperers story line in season 9? Now I know they come in around episode 8 but could it be possible that Kang moves it quicker? Not stretching out the conflict across two seasons. I know it's hard to believe because we've had nothing but drawn out conflicts but I'm starting to believe that she can turn the show around. That will never make up for Rick leaving or Maggie leaving or even the catalyst of all the recent news which is the death of Carl. I just wonder if maybe we could be nearing the end. With either season 10 or 11. Not shitty AMC antics aside I do think it'll be like when the office ended. It ended because the CAST wanted to. And with AMCs plans of keeping the universe alive I could see them ending at 10 or 11 and then staring up another spin off.

Negan,"Why is he a bad guy and a good guy at the same time?

I hated his fucking guts after what he did to Glen and Abraham. It was brutal and cruel and traunatic to watch.

Yet, he did it for a reason. Rick's group had just killed thirty or so of his men. 

Instead of killing them all, he only killed two of theirs. He had a point for it, and quite frankly, it was merciful judging by what they'd done to him.

He killed the guy who tried to supplant Rick.

He didn't harm Carl *at all* even after Carl killed two more of his men.

He has never hit any of his wives.

He killed the guy who tried to rape Sasha.

He's clearly a sociopath, but he isn't chaotic evil. 

Wtf.

Deanna Monroe - Last President of the United States?,"According to the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution, there are 17 members of the Presidential Line of Succession begining with the Vice President and moving to the Speaker of the House and through the Cabinet Secretaries.

Tell me I'm not alone on this.,"Okay so I was a huge TWD fan for years but I lost most of my respect for the show in one specific moment.  
I can't remember exactly what episode but shortly after Rick has started the war against Negan, they launch an attack on his base driving a truck into the building and holding down the perimeter with rifles.  Negan and the crew walk outside onto the catwalk to see whatsup. It's important to mention at this point Rick is hell bent on killing Negan that is his current goal.
They then proceed to f*ing show Rick point his gun at Negan and hold him in his sights and choose not to fire until they have a lame round of dialogue.  At which point Negan gets away.
It was at this exact moment that I decided TWD has entirely stopped caring about any kind of realism in their narrative.

Telltale game's current season/Comics timeline,"OK, so I've noticed since episode 2 dropped yesterday and the appearance of James, now everyone's saying that the timeline of the game is years ahead of the comics. Genuinely asking; how did people come to that conclusion? Did Telltale or Robert Kirkman say this?

The Whisperer arc has been over for awhile in the comics, and James showing up in episode 2 could simply be weeks or months after the war ended, not full years. And the way James referenced the war didn't come off as years to me. 

Unless there's concrete evidence about Clementine's current age and that's what people are going off then no, I don't believe the game is ahead of the comics timeline (in years).",1,"Telltale game's current season/Comics timeline OK, so I've noticed since episode 2 dropped yesterday and the appearance of James, now everyone's saying that the timeline of the game is years ahead of the comics.

Morgan Theory,"(This theory operates under the assumption that Rick Grimes is likely going to leave or die in the main show.)

I think Morgan will return to TWD. Not immediately, as that wouldn‚Äôt be as impactful as his previous returns but more likely in Season 9b, potentially after disappearing off Fear. I reckon the return is likely and that he will arrive in time to hear about Rick‚Äôs recent death/departure.

On a side note, I‚Äôm completely for the notion that Rick‚Äôs death is a major callback to Season 1 and like how the clues and Easter eggs have set it up so far, so Morgan turning up a bit later would probably add to that.

[Game Spoiler] (if you haven't played it to an extent ) An Idea for Telltale's The Walking Dead Final Final Ending,"I just finished watching a youtuber's playthrough of the Final Season's Episode 2 and I've been keeping this idea for the final ending ( hoping that it actually gets done ) with me for a while now.

Some people hated the fact that Lily came back and I've come with a worse idea along these lines. With the release of season 1, many players were delighted with the idea of their choices actually affecting the game. And, along with that, the very same number of players were disappointed with these decisions not really affecting the game much, ""the illusion of choice."" I do agree, however, since they rolled out a season after another, that the idea of these choices affecting the game would've been unmaintainable; characters would/could have various models, different scenarios, along with different lines and many others would require much more assets and would be bonkers in terms of the amount of money and time required to accomplish this continuously over the different seasons. 

However, since they are ending the series, why not make use of the earlier decisions that the player has done. Although, this would mean that the earlier seasons would be a prerequisite, but for the sake of discussion, let's ignore this. 

Here's my idea; bring back Lee. 

Oh, I can already hear the dis. Here's the thing though, you have to have had done TWO things to make Lee come back; (1) Lee should've cut an arm off when he was bit and (2) Clem should NOT have shot Lee at the end of Season 1. Didn't shoot Lee but did not cut his arm off? No Lee. Or, at least hint that Lee's alive, in episode 3, if the two conditions were fulfilled with his handcuffs being broken and his carcass not being there and, then, bring him back in episode 4. But, obviously though, this would mean that this should only be a branch of the story, so, good luck with matching this in terms of intensity and feelings, I think.

If anything, I just wanted to see the promise of Telltale where your decisions would've mattered. I don't know if anyone has pitched this idea before, but, what do you guys think?

But before the walkers can  eat him, the other ones save him (and we will see a kiss scene between  Ezekiel and Carol).

While everyones walking on a road. Ezekiel asks Carol to marry him. She  will not say yes but she will also not say no. Ezekiel will laugh and  say that he loves her and always will. They will arrive at a broken  bridge and will be surprised by walkers. They have to get away, but Ken  runs back to try and save a horse, and the walkers will catch him and he  gets bit.

Maggie will talk later to Tammy Rose and Earl and tells them about the  death of their son. At the funeral, Alden will sing a song for him and  Gregory's last words will be ""Cheers kid, rest in peace"".

She will go there with her baby and will  be attacked by the drunken Earl. Enid comes to help and get hit and  knocked out hard by him. Others come to help Maggie. Maggie went to  Gregory to confront him with that and they will fight. Grgeory can't see  Maggie as lead because he thinks it was all his work that build up Hilltop.

Thoughts on Season 8,"After a lacklustre Season 7 (that I personally still enjoyed), the first half of Season 8 was a mixed bag. I never felt like it was bad from week to week but it was also a bit slow and repetitive. Really liked some moments though, like the return of Morales (been waiting for that for ages and surprised it actually happened lol). I was quite disappointed/upset with the mid season finale and didn‚Äôt quite have that same feeling of anticipation for the second half. This caused me to be quite slow with watching my recordings and I only managed to watch episodes 9 and 10 before my DVR got wiped and so I decided to wait for the Blu-ray release to catch up. Finally started watching again and the last few episodes of Season 8 really had me hooked. I loved the episode with Gabriel about faith and was genuinely invested in his journey with Doc Carson and upset by Carson‚Äôs tragic death. Episode 14 was a great one too. As a comic book reader, I thought Carl‚Äôs letter was the show‚Äôs greatest opportunity to change Rick‚Äôs mind and set up the ending of All Out War/start of A New Beginning as the show approached the end of Season 8 and start of Season 9 and I actually liked the group of Saviours who wanted to ‚Äúlive forever‚Äù with their community ‚Äúafter‚Äù it all, so that twist literally had my jaw dropping. It was a great scene from a great episode. That second half of Season 8 actually gives me hope for Rick‚Äôs final episodes and maybe even for the rest of the show‚Äôs lifetime after Rick.

These two bits of into don't make sense together. If the whisperers are in the area, how would it be that Rick is killed by one, but the big confrontation doesn't come for years. There's no way the two groups don't clash from now to then

‚ÄòFear The Walking Dead‚Äô:Morgan Gets Threatened in Season 4 Finale Sneak Peek,,1,
A new theory based on TheWalkingDead comics actually reveals how Rick could return.,,1,
Telltales The walking dead season 4 episode 2 discussion thread,"Seeing as no one else made one I figured I might as well. I'll start off by giving my thoughts.

I loved this episode, really a step up from the first. Seeing Lilly again was cool, was really hoping we'd see Christa again eventually but oh well. My favorite part was definitely James, the whisperer. I loved the direct reference to the comics which we've never really gotten. I thought Jesus' appearance in season 3 was really poorly handled, and this some what makes up for it. James' appearance also confirms this takes place after the whisperer war and likely years ahead of the comics which I think we all assumed but it's nice to have confirmation. Being able to choose Clems partner was interesting, I think alot of people were asking for the option to have her be a lesbian so that's cool. The fight at the school was exciting, I'm normally not a huge fan of the action sequences but I enjoyed this one. The few zombie sequences in this episode were pretty boring but there weren't many of them so that's fine.

Finally, let's talk about telltale games. If this truly is the final episode of the game, I couldn't be more disappointed. This was a great episode but it's no ending for such a great game that I and many others have been invested in for nearly 7 years. There are still so many loose ends to tie up I'll be heart broken if this is it. If the game doesn't continue I really hope we get a comic or at the very least the scripts for the final 2 episodes. Here's hoping.

Overall it was a very good episode 9/10",1,"Telltales The walking dead season 4 episode 2 discussion thread Seeing as no one else made one I figured I might as well. I'll start off by giving my thoughts.

Had to write essay on a TV show.,"Came to the conclusion that Rick is an far right anarchist.  Hates any kind of organized government or any restriction of control over firearms.  He is constantly preaching that he wants things back to normal, but has indirectly or directly lead to the destruction of several fairly advanced societies.  Just because they had some flaws. (Which every society has without fail) Rick just has this mindset that he should be able to tear down any hint of civilization if they exhibit any authoritarian aspects.

Predicament I'm in regarding the future of the show.,"I have always loved TWD. I've been watching religiously since the pilot and I haven't missed a single live episode since episode 1. Like many of you I was destroyed when Carl was killed. Also being a big fan of the comics since its inception I couldn't understand the logic in killing him off. (still don't) but I was able to move on. I thought with news of a new showrunner and differently paced ninth season it can be brought back from the dead and thrive again.

But then we learned Rick will die.

I was torn again. I couldn't justify enjoying this show anymore especially since I've been a fan since day one. I felt so betrayed and let down from a show I once defended and thought was better than Game Of Thrones (I know it's not even at its best) but now with the positive news I'm hearing about the ninth season from sites who have very good reviews regarding TWD. Specifically Erik Kain from Forbes. Although he's very harsh none of his points are wrong. It's been especially hard defending this show lately. I guess the problem I'm having now is knowing Rick is leaving and that the show IS going to lose a significant part of what made it appealing in the first place, do still love the show for what it is regardless of who is or is not alive? Or should I just keep watching outta obligation to see it through to the end? I get this is a total first world problem but it's something that's been bugging me since news broke of Andy Lincolns departure.

I'm basically having a hard time accepting if I can still like the show no matter how great it becomes when one large parts of what make it important will be gone. Anyone else feel similar?

Feel free to shit on me as much as you'd like, I get how reddit works. ",1,"Predicament I'm in regarding the future of the show. I have always loved TWD.

What is wrong with logic in tv show?,"I can't say that i am not enjoying it, but some moments leave me in complete frustration. Let's take one of the biggest, right from FTWD Ep6 ending and Ep7 beginning, and look closely on what happened: 

3 people want to AMBUSH and slaughter entire group. When group appears, characters... step forwards, completly at the open, and aim guns at entire group that's covered behind the cars, each of them having a weapon. For those of you who don't remember how close they were to each other before first shot was fiered, here, look: http://ipic.su/img/img7/fs/FTWD.1537879551.jpg

Next episode starts - main characters are covered behind cars, shooting at hostile group. Question: what happened between those 2 scenes? How 3 people standing right before entire group pointing guns on them proceed to taking cover without a single wound? Did director realized that any logical explanation to this will fail, so he just skipped to the scene where they already in cover? 

That's only one silly scene, there is a lot more of them. Funny thing is - it's really easy to fix it: simply make main characters take cover instantly when they spot the caravan approaching, and talk to them from that cover! I can't believe that in a show with such large budget people oversee this kind of obvious bullshit. Is there really nobody who could say them ""Hey, how this scene even makes sense? Why not make them take cover asap?"". I can't believe that all people responcible for the creation of this show failed to see how silly it looks, so, can anyone explain - why they let things like this constantly be pushed into production? I feel like both TWD and FTWD need to hire a common sense specialist who will stop them each time they making something like this. ",1,"What is wrong with logic in tv show?

Then in Episode 4, Clementine disguises herself as a walker in the herd, switching between killing walkers and fighting Lilly. Lilly dies and Clementine is bit. However, before she dies she wants to make it back to the school to say goodbye. This is hinted at in a trophy that says ""Came full circle"", leading me to believe that AJ will put down an infected Clem. After he does so, a cross on a grave appears with her name; her hat hanging from the cross.

"[spoilers?]: Theory about Fear TWD, the Comics and Season 9","I have a thought...

Spoilers for all sorts of stuff if you aren't current and haven't heard rumors:

So as of the last episode, it looks like Morgan and his new gang are making their way to Alexandria.

But...if the rumors are true about not one, but TWO time jumps in Season 9, you would think they would have arrived by then.

So if they aren't there, either they are all dead, OR, they got held up somewhere.

My theory (spawned by something I read) is that they will introduce The Commonwealth in Fear the Walking Dead, and NOT in TWD.  Ohio is between Texas and Virginia and while not the most direct route, is definitely feasible. 

This gives Fear at least another season on their own, and TWD time to deal with and wrap up The Whisperers and would come in right as things might need to be re-invented.",1,"[spoilers?]: Theory about Fear TWD, the Comics and Season 9 I have a thought...

"Game Spoilers: With the recent happenings, Telltale's TWD Season 3 and all the spin-offs now feel like a complete waste of time.","I was one of the few that actually liked the third season of Telltale's The Walking Dead. Even with an entirely new cast, and still similar dumb decisions made by some characters, I liked it for what it was. The spin-offs to me feel like a waste of time from the beginning, but I was okay with what they were trying to do for the third season.

But with what recently happened to Telltale, I feel that if they're not going to revisit these characters in the final season, the third season feels like a complete waste of time. Time that could've been used to properly conclude Clementine's story, and to see if she is going to make it and encounter the main cast of the series. It really is a bummer on how mismanaged the series and the company is as a whole.",1,"Game Spoilers: With the recent happenings, Telltale's TWD Season 3 and all the spin-offs now feel like a complete waste of time.

The future of clem and the walking dead,"I know I know I know. Kirkman has already stated that Clem and her universe will not be brought into the live action universe, but as with life, crap happens. There are many many things that we could not have predicted, first with Carl, then Rick, Maggie's eventual departure, the fear crew being gutted and now with telltale and clems story. 

AMC claims that they have years worth of the walking dead material left but seriously what sort of new characters could they possibly bring into the universe that don't run the risk of flopping at this point? They did good with fear at it's prime, Nick and Madison were characters I fell in love with just as much as Rick and crew, with shows and movies in the works for the future there is no better time than now to bring Clem into the live action fold so her story can be properly laid out for the fans who put so much stock into her world, I myself have bought the telltale games on pc, switch and Xbox one.

There are so many wonderful characters to introduce that will bring the walking dead back from it's ironic death march. I would watch a TV show on Kenny alone.

I know it's a long shot but I believe this is the best route to go. Does anyone else feel this way or have any ideas?",1,"The future of clem and the walking dead I know I know I know.

9x01: We are introduced to Rick and the others travelling into Washington where they go to a museum, the city has been taken over by the overgrowth. They take many medieval items from the museum and head back to base camp, here many members from all communities together to build a new world. We see the Sanctuary with Daryl, the Hilltop with Maggie and Rick and group back in Alexandria. Rick goes and talks to Negan and is told that his leadership style won't work, meanwhile in the sanctuary a member of the hilltop has a fight with a member of the sanctuary and Daryl puts a stop to it. Afterwards he confronts Rick and tells him that the groups are all to large and that they can't work together. The next day many people are building and we see this new medieval style life on a larger scale, meanwhile at the Hilltop Maggie is attacked by Gregory before Jesus takes her away. Maggie hangs Gregory in front of the members of the hilltop. Rick goes down to talk to Negan again and Negan asks Rick if he regrets keeping him alive, Rick says ""I regret it everyday, but you are suffering more now.""

The next day members from other communities start repairing the bridge, King Ezekiel, Carol and the Kingdom head to the basecamp. That night they all gather round a fire to see how far they've come, The next morning Rick heads to the Hilltop and Daryl attacks a saviour before before being stopped. When Rick arrives at the Hilltop he finds out Maggie killed Gregory in front of members of the Hilltop, Rick shouts at Maggie and she punches him. She apologises after and Rick walks away in anger and heads back to Alexandria. Meanwhile on the bridge another fight breaks out between Daryl and a saviour and Aaron and a saviour, Daryl and Carol discuss this outside that night.

That night, Ann arrives at the Junkyard and is seen searching for something. Carol is attacked in the night by the same saviour but Daryl finds her, the saviour puts a knife to here throat and tells Daryl to put his crossbow down. Daryl puts it down and kicks it away, the saviour member pulls out a gun at Daryl and let's go of Carol. He goes up to Daryl and before he can pull the trigger, Aaron kills him. The next morning Maggie looks at Hershel and thinks about Glenn which makes her cry, Jesus comes up to her and tells her that killing Gregory was the right thing to do and that Rick was wrong. Ann is seen talking over the radio to the helicopter, she asks them where they have been and they don't answer. They tell her that she and the communities need to be careful and they fly away. Rick goes to the sanctuary and gives the saviours some supplies, however he finds out that the saviour was killed by Aaron after he tried to kill Carol and Daryl. Rick, being shocked leaves the Sanctuary and goes back to Alexandria. On his way him and the other see a sign saying ""final warning"" and they wonder who wrote it.

9x04: Michonne and Negan talk about his cell life, Rick and Michonne walk with Judith through a thriving Alexandria and a beautiful field. New members are exited to see Rick and Michonne points out that night to Rick that he is ""famous"". The next morning Daryl and Rick head to the bridge on his motorbike and many others go to the bridge to witness the final construction. On the way Rick says to Daryl that even though him and Carol were almost killed, he shouldn't kill the Saviours that planned it but they should imprison them. Daryl stops the bike and throws it on the ground, Rick and Daryl argue and Rick apologises for not being respectful of Daryl. When they arrive at the bridge a massive walker horde is heading for the bridge. A hilltop member asks Maggie what to do and she responds ""I don't know"". And the hilltop member says ""Rick would know.""

9x05: Rick and Daryl see the walker horde and they head towards it, Rick tells Daryl to go to everyone on the bridge while he takes a horse from a member of the hilltop. Rick rides the horse behind the walker herd and shoots his gun, attracting them all towards him, meanwhile Daryl goes to the bridge and sees Maggie arming everyone. Daryl tells Maggie that ""Rick has this under control"" and Michonne is concerned. Rick is riding the horse down the road and he sees a walker in the middle of the road. Suddenly the Walker pulls out a machete and hacks of one on the horses legs as Rick rides past, Rick falls of and is knocked out. He is woken up by a walker stabbing him in the gut multiple times, he realises that the walker is saying ""don't scream"" while Rick is being stabbed. Rick bites the throat of this mysterious human/walker and starts heading back to the bridge, the walkers are closing in on him and when Rick looks behind him another human/walker is running towards him with a knife. Rick starts running but is bleeding out fast, he makes it back to the road and approaches the bridge. Daryl, Michonne, Maggie, Carol and the others all see Rick and the walker horde. Rick looks behind him and the human/walker is gone. Rick collapses, Daryl and the others run towards the walkers to start taking them out. Jerry grabs Rick and takes him to Siddiq, he tries to stop the bleeding but there are multiple stab wounds.

He also tells her that he loves her and that she's the best woman who has ever been in his life. Rick tells Carol that he never thought she would make it, and that he is proud of her. He tells Maggie that he was sorry for shouting at her, and that killing Gregory was the right thing to do. He tells her that he spared Negan for Carl and that he should've thought about her. Rick finally tells Daryl that he doesn't know what is happening, but that he knows that the thing that killed him wasn't a walker but a person in a walker mask. He tells Daryl that this human/walker was whispering. Rick tells them all that he tried his best as a leader, and that he is glad that all the communities are trying to bring back what the world once was. We see a perspective of Rick look at the group, however he sees his old friends with them. His best friend Shane, Maggies father Hershel and his Son Carl. He sees other members who have died and then looks to the other side to see the remaining members. Rick finally dies in the arms of Daryl, Michonne is weeping and everyone is silent.

"Which characters heads should end up on pikes by Season 9, Episode 8?","In the comic, 10 minor characters and Rosita and Ezekiel get the pike moment. In the show, it hasn't occurred yet but is theorized to happen by 9x08. 

Here's my list of preferred characters to get the pike:

1. Tara - unfunny, unnecessary and pointless since Season 4. And Alanna Masterson's horrible acting ruins every scene. She is only there because of Scientology.
2. Ezekiel - he dropped the King acting for a minute after his tiger died, but then went back to his speaking Shakespeare. It's over the top cheesy and irritating. Khary Payton is a good actor but he is given shit material.
3. Eugene - I've had enough of his grating, mumbling, thesaurus dialogue. 
4. Jesus - the badass ninja introduction turned into retarded pacifism, which turned into conspiring against Rick. The character is a mess.
5. Henry - please tell me he's not replacing Carl. 
6. Maggie - since season 7, she's been entirely bland, and has only one stern facial expression. Plus, her southern accent has deteriorated, a lot. Maggie's relationship with Glenn was kind of the whole point of the character, much like Rick &amp; Carl.

6. Maggie - since season 7, she's been entirely bland, and has only one stern facial expression. Plus, her southern accent has deteriorated, a lot. Maggie's relationship with Glenn was kind of the whole point of the character, much like Rick &amp; Carl. 
7. Enid - All she does is mope.

I feel like, if the rest of it is canceled and there is no possibility of it ever being finished, we should get a summary of what happens. Leaving it open-ended wouldn't do justice to Clem and her story. It'd be awesome if we could just read what happens. I feel awful for everyone involved with this situation, but I feel like many of them would agree that Clem's story deserves to be finished.

Never been more depressed,"Been playing and following Telltale‚Äôs The Walking Dead Game since release over 5 years ago. So much time, effort, and emotion invested in Clementine and her fight for survival after Lee. She was my number two to Rick Grimes. 

When I saw that Telltale is cancelling it and shutting down I legit sat there with my mouth open. This is by far the shittiest thing to ever happen and if this remains to be true and the season is truly cancelled I‚Äôm not sure I can stick with The Walking Dead any longer.  Rick‚Äôs gonna be gone and now Clem‚Äôs gonna be gone without even a worthy conclusion to her long, endured struggle. Just what the fuck. 

I‚Äôm so bitter and desperate right now I‚Äôm just praying they at least finish the season. I can‚Äôt go through another beloved character put on ice even though they don‚Äôt deserve it...I cant go through another Half Life...

There would be a second spin-off series, video games, merchandise, it would become a phenomenon.

But, you already know how the documentary ends. The shows were cancelled, the video game was never finished(the company went out of business), everyone involved is doing something else now. But, no one ever really understood how something so good could go so bad. Was it bad writing, office politics, or cheap studios? Why did the whole Walking Dead universe seem to sabotage itself?

10 ideas for rebooting The Walking Dead (very long),"While there seems to be broad disagreement about the specific reasons and details, I still think there's a general consensus both here and at /r/FearTheWalkingDead that the entire franchise in a decline right now.  For starters, the loss of Rick, Carl, Maggie, Glen, Abraham, Madison, and Nick all within a couple seasons is... ""alarming"" is probably a term we can all agree upon.  And I don't think I'm going out on a limb by saying the storytelling isn't improving either (to put it mildly).  

So I think it's fair to say the series might be nearing a natural conclusion pretty soon.  But it would be a shame for *The Walking Dead* to die and not come back.  There's so much wasted potential in this IP and in the right hands it could be much better.  I, for one, would be very happy to see a reboot come along sooner rather than later, and it would be a great opportunity for it to be done right this time.

My 10 suggestions:

- I don't know the details of *TWD*'s IP situation so I don't know if AMC has to remain involved, but the important thing is to bring in a new creative team and give them the freedom to craft good teleplays.  Bring in a showrunner with some credibility-- bonus points if there's some horror pedigree.   Find somebody talented and passionate about the genre.

- On *Star Trek* there were hundreds of people on board, but we didn't get back stories for each crew member.  Keep the story focused on a small handful of characters and make us care about them.  Resist the temptation to bloat the cast, which seems like a fundamental force that acts upon television shows over time.  Use secondary characters sparingly and always for story purposes rather than to fill time.  

- On the other hand, don't kill popular characters just to advance a story arc.  The conceit of nearly every narrative fiction is that the heroes tend to survive.  Audiences are okay with that.  I'm not saying you can't ever do it, but it's delicate and those moments should be rare and profound when they do happen.    

- Tighten up the story.  Negan and the Governor should be combined into a single, more well developed villain.  Michonne/Daryl, Andrea/Carol, and Tyrese/Dale as well.   

- Keep the group fairly grounded in a location, whether Alexandria or the prison-- perhaps Rick is in Alexandria and the Governor is in the prison, each wants what the other has.  Other emerging colonies in interesting locations (and with interesting characters) will keep things fresh.   Don't wander too much on the road, going from place to place-- you just end up repeating the same story at different locations (settle new area, encounter villain, get overrun, wander, repeat).  In an unstable world with unstable protagonists, the audience needs something to hold on to.  

- Kill Lori, not Shane.  The dynamic is much more interesting if that triangle is Rick, Shane, and Carl, especially if Carl blames Rick for Lori's death.

- Focus on terror *and* horror.  You need both to make a zombie story work.   It doesn't have to be full-on *Day of the Dead* ""Choke on 'em!"" all the time, but *TWD* should be violent, terrifying, and revolting.  That said, violence is very delicate too.  It's fun watching zombies lose their heads, not so much Glen and Abraham.  Use good judgment and remember that audiences prefer entertainment to abuse.  

- Back away from some of the more far-fetched or even absurd story elements.  We're already meant to accept the fact that corpses are walking around, so we shouldn't be expected to accept too many other conceits.  Ezekiel is fine, but no tiger.  Along those lines, Rick can't be comatose in a hospital bed for any extended period and then just wake up and walk away-- I like the idea of having the protagonist discover that world with the audience *in media res*, but there are other ways to do it.  Maybe Rick's a divorced former sheriff's deputy who has been living off the grid for a while, and once he discovers what's happened to the world he decides he wants it back.   

- Take a page from *Westworld* and ""see the beauty"" in that world.  Enough with the over saturation and ugly filters.  Put artists behind the camera and give us a visual spectacle.  An undead world has limitless potential for art.  As a non-artist, my only other artistic suggestion is more crane shots with 500 extras; fewer CG herds. 

- Finally, rather than produce an aimless, wildly inconsistent companion series like *FTWD*, produce a high-quality 20 minute web-series with episodes featuring expanded content like back stories, side stories, etc.  The highlight could be a long-running companion web-series about what many have suggested should have been the focus of *Fear*: how a seemingly normal American family becomes The Whisperers (the ultimate arch-villains of the series).  When they finally arrive on TWD, fans will already know who they are, how they became that way and exactly what they're capable of.  And if it's done right, we'll probably like them too.  We'll get them.  All of this would complicate things that final season when the Whisperers force the warring colonies to band together as fellow human beings in order to survive, leading to something resembling a new, thriving civilization when it's all over.     

Anyway, that's just my two-cents on what I think could be done to save *The Walking Dead*.  Even if you think all my specific ideas are stupid, in a world full of reboots I think we can mostly agree a rebooted *TWD* is one reboot people may actually want, so I'd be curious to know if anyone else has suggestions or ideas on how to do this.

TSDF Q&amp;A Episode 9.1 ‚ÄúA New Beginning‚Äù,"Annnnnd we‚Äôre back! Here we go season 9! Big thanks to our sources!!!


**What is the group‚Äôs mission that was filmed at the Capitol building? What happens during those scenes?**

A group including Rick, Michonne, Daryl, Maggie, Carol, Ezekiel, and most of the other main characters go into the capitol building, scavenging. They find a large wagon and a horsedrawn plow and  seeds. While lowering the wagon down the huge stairway, Ezekiel is almost killed by walkers when he falls through a hole in the clear glass floor (which is breaking under all of the weight.) The lower level under the floor is overrun. He is saved, just in time from being bitten.


**What‚Äôs going on at the Sanctuary? Who‚Äôs in charge?**

The Saviors are struggling. There is barely any food or supplies. Their crops are failing. There are some that hold real animosity. There are still Negan followers.

Daryl is in charge of the Sanctuary, but does not want to be. He expresses to Rick that he wants out! Carol overhears their conversation and tells Rick that she will take over.


**Are there any characters that are showing animosity towards each other?**

There is a group of Negan followers at the Sanctuary, quiet grumblings. Daryl is showing slight signs towards Rick. Gregory towards Maggie, as she is now leader of Hilltop, per a Hilltop election. Maggie towards Rick. Earl's wife towards Maggie after her sons death.

**Tell us about Maggie‚Äôs baby!**

Little Hershel is so adorable! He lives at Hilltop with Maggie of course. He is seen several times in this episode.


**We hear that Gregory enlists Earl‚Äôs help to kill Maggie. What happens during this attempt?**


After Earl's son Ken gets bitten in a small herd scene in the opening scenes, Maggie has to put him down. Gregory gets Earl drunk and enthusiastically runs down Maggie, making it seem that it's all her fault. Late one evening as Maggie is walking a fussy Hershel, Gregory tells her that someone has been messing with Glenn's grave. She goes to investigate and is attacked by a masked Earl. Hershel‚Äôs stroller gets flung to the ground with him in it and he starts screaming. Enid also gets knocked out in the struggle. People hear the ruckus and come to the rescue. Maggie goes to Gregory and he tries to kill her. She gets the upper hand. Gregory is dealt with at end of episode.

**Do we meet Magna‚Äôs group in this episode?**

They are not seen or introduced in this episode.

**How does the episode end?**

It's dark at Hilltop. Children are put to bed. Rick, Michonne, and Daryl are there. Enid is sitting in a wheelchair from her injury when she helped save Maggie. A crowd gathers and we see Gregory on the gallows with a noose around his neck. He is begging for his life in his typical Gregory-pathetic way. Maggie makes a speech and he is hanged, much to the shock of Rick and Michonne.

BONUS:

* Ezekiel proposes to Carol. She says something along the lines of ‚ÄúOh put that thing away. I would snag it on something.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt say no, but also doesn‚Äôt say yes either. Carol tells Daryl that she wanted to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù but wanted to give it some time to be sure.

"Thoughts on Daryl, from S5-now.","I started thinking about Daryl, his arc, everything about his character from the start of the series until now. At first I figured his down turn into a mumbling mess was just part of his arc, but that went on too long. It would be understandable if it lasted until they arrived at Alexandria and he started coming out of his shell as he tried to adjust to that life. But they didn't do that, they just kept him as almost a B character. To the point where even long time ""If Daryl dies we riot"" fans were turning on him.

Given Andrew's departure and how obvious it is that Angela Kang wants to bring Daryl back to his s3-s4 best, I wonder if his down turn wasn't purposeful.  I wonder if he wasn't specifically written to have fans turn their backs on him.

I wasn't a fan when seasons 3 and 4, what I consider his peak, so I didn't know anything about the show. But I absolutely knew who Daryl Dixon was and I actually assumed he was the main character. I even asked people ""Oh, that zombie show with Norman Reedus?"". Based on stuff I would see on Yahoo or things that would pop up on social media, it was pretty obvious to me that Daryl was the main character.  I never even heard the name Rick Grimes until I started binge watching the show. Daryl was on all the merch, he was the face of the show as far as I knew.

So I wonder if Gimple didn't purposely turn Daryl in such a way that people would start to ignore Daryl or even hate him. Maybe they realized that Daryl was the most well known character on the show, outside of true fans. And he wanted to change that. It's almost Fonzie effect in reverse. Instead of realizing he was the most well known and putting him in the forefront, Gimple went the other way and wanted to ensure that Richie was the focus.

Now that he's leaving they have no choice but to make Daryl the face of the franchise again.

[FUTURE SPOILERS] Huge news about Daryl.,"So I checked some early reviews for the premiere episode and all of them were very opened on about the fact the Daryl is the character that impressed them the most, besides the fact that he finally got natural conversation and dialogues with other characters the most important news are the fact that Rick made him the leader at the Sanctuary. I knew that Angela Kang sayd that Daryl will start at the Sanctuary and Reedus teased that Daryl found his voice again and that he will be a person the people look up to but I didn't expected this at all, I kinda like this idea even with how things played in the comics at that time because it makes sense for Rick to put in charge a leader considering the Survivors and the Saviors just had a war.

Seems like there's a scene on the road with Daryl and Cyndie when they go to DC and they are talking about Marle most probably about Cyndie's brother too. There's always a delight to keep Merle's spirit alive on the show because he played a big iconic part in the show's early days.

He's also telling Rick that he missing being on the road, that with a smaller group they can do anything and that he's uncomfortable with him being put in charge at the Sanctuary. And this is where I want to start because the character got a lot of potential.

I can see Rick playing power games for keeping his friend close encouraging him to step up after he choosed to keep Negan alive, besides the fact that he's trusting Daryl the most.

Dwight took over the Saviors in the comics but the idea of Rick putting someone in charge excited me being an interesting remix from the comics.

Daryl hates the Saviors basically because they reminded him of the man he used to be before the apocalypse, the man that he hates now. Nothing better for his character than to conquer the things that he hates and fears. I do think he's some sort of a sub-leader considering that the Sanctuary is under Rick's judgment but it's gonna be interesting to see the guy who was the janitor when Negan burned Mark's face in front of everybody becoming the leader now.

We saw Daryl in the latest teaser that he's too looking at the * Saviors save us, we are still Negan*. Also he's very active working on the bridge with the Saviors (the workers at least) from what we saw but Justin, Jed, Regina and Arat are still Negan so that's that.

Sorry for making it long post. Thanks for reading.",1,"[FUTURE SPOILERS] Huge news about Daryl.

Shane should have lived...,"
See, I liked Shane as a character. He was mean, he was willing to do the hard things, and he was a bit of an asshole, and quote frankly, one of my favorite Antagonists from The Walking Dead. And Many can agree with me on that.

Now, I understand that in the comics, Shane died. It was inevitable. He needed to, but. I would have taken a much different route in the show, while at the same time, following the same path.

Season 2 was leading up until Shane‚Äôs death. ANd was leading up to the big reveal- ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all infected.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how I would have done things, and what I feel would have been better. In my opinion (OH NO! I‚ÄôM SHARING MY OPINION ON THE INTERNET!)

Shane lures randel out into the woods still, and that plays out‚Ä¶ pretty much the same. Than leads Rick out into the field. Rick becomes aware of what Shane was trying to do, like he did- and gains the upper hand, wounding Shane. Shane begins to flee towards the forest more, wounded, and Rick shoots after him, drawing the Walkers in. Shane fleas, and it ends like that.

The walkers attack, they flee, head to the prison, than Terminus, and so on- so forth.

Now, here‚Äôs what I would have liked.

Ricks crew makes it to Alexandria. They meet the Saviors while at the Hilltop, kill them, but one manages to escape, and maybe he says something like ‚ÄúWalsh ain‚Äôt gonna be happy about this!‚Äù

Time goes on, and we get to the S6 finale. The Negan Line up. Than S7. Than S8.

Rick, Carl, and Daryl are on a run, to one of the Saviors outposts, as they see someone standing before them. It was Shane.

Shane steps foward, and his facial expression is the realization that this was Rick. And Carl. And Daryl. And Shane realizes that Rick has been the one causing all the damage, and is *the* rick from Alexandria. And Rick tries to talk Shane down, explaining about Maggie, and Glenn. And all of that.

Shane was placed as a head of one of the many outposts.

Now, i don‚Äôt know what else could happen. Just a thought. ",1,"Shane should have lived...

Ricks crew makes it to Alexandria. They meet the Saviors while at the Hilltop, kill them, but one manages to escape, and maybe he says something like ‚ÄúWalsh ain‚Äôt gonna be happy about this!‚Äù

Time goes on, and we get to the S6 finale. The Negan Line up. Than S7. Than S8.

Rick, Carl, and Daryl are on a run, to one of the Saviors outposts, as they see someone standing before them. It was Shane.

Shane steps foward, and his facial expression is the realization that this was Rick. And Carl. And Daryl. And Shane realizes that Rick has been the one causing all the damage, and is *the* rick from Alexandria. And Rick tries to talk Shane down, explaining about Maggie, and Glenn. And all of that.

Shane was placed as a head of one of the many outposts.

Now, i don‚Äôt know what else could happen. Just a thought. "

[Spoilers] Was this the most underratedly pointless death in the series?,"I'm talking about Merle. After  going MIA from the rooftop in Atlanta he winds up in Woodbury and starts to show some real character development. He was so close to becoming a valued member of the group, but then he execcuted a pointless plan to try to kill the Governor which literally resulted in nothing of note coming from it besides his own death. His death is way more pointless than Beth's in my opinion because someone as skilled as Merle shouldn't have gone out like that. At least Beth stabbed the person she was after.

Season 5 : Rewriting the fight in Alexandria between Rick and,"I'm pretty sure I'm in the majority that Rick should have destroyed that guy. Rick was a lot tougher here , both mentally and physically. This is where he reached the point of Shane. Pete was just a drunk wife beater, while Rick was a cop, and fought and survived before he came to Alexandria. Seeing Rick struggle with him was hard to watch. So I want to change this , while making a homage to Shane beating Ed, a perfect time to do something like this . Since like I said before, Rick had caught up to Shane here.

**Fix**: Rick tells Jess he can keep her safe. She goes home thinking about that. Pete walks in, all drunk and angry. He tells her he's been seeing her talk to Rick, and demands to know why. She tries to placate him, but he just gets angrier and angrier, he starts to shouting and pins her to the wall. This is where Rick comes to the rescue. He tells them they're going to leave , Pete says ""this is my house!"" yada yada like in canon, then he charges Rick. They struggle for a few seconds, but then Rick tackles him into the window, and they're now on the street. Rick gets up and grabs him by the hair ,dragging him to the middle of the cul-de-sac and pushes him down. Then , just like Shane and Ed, Rick pummels him in a near identical fashion. Then everything else happens more or less the same (speech and whatnot).

So there. It's a more satisfying scene to watch, further drives the point that Rick has sorta become Shane, and shows Rick's toughness even better.

Rant : One of the things I hate the most about the show,"The thing I despise the most is that I have to watch living characters that I hate and the ones I liked are dead.

Hate: Enid

Like: Carl

* She annoys the hell out of me, her acting and attitude. Carl had a lot more potential , and I was starting to like him even more, until season 8. If he lived, and if Season 7 Carl was in Season 8, it would have been awesome.

Hate: Tara

Like : Abraham

* Yeah. I'm part of the large group that dislikes Tara. How is she still alive? It's a big shame that Abraham is gone. He was a cool guy, and season 7/8 would have been his time to shine!

Hate: Negan

Like: Governor

* I wanted to jump through the screen so many times so I can hurt Negan. God-fucking-damn did he annoy the shit out of me, his whole way of being, and his obsession with Lucille. He was one big cartoon character. It really made me appreciate the Governor so much more.  He was much more threatening that Negan ever was. 

Hate: Eugene

Like: Shane

* Does Eugene have a mental disorder?! Geez I wish he had bit the dust a few times.  I can't believe I had to watch him act like a pussy so many times when I would've preferred a million times over to have  had Jon Bernthal's Shane go batshit on Negan, Terminus,  Governor, the cannibals , and Joe's group.

Rick leaving made me realise how much i still love the show even after all the ups and downs,"After seeing all the Ricks last episodes promos and pictures, i find myself still holding onto the hope that somehow Rick survives and im one of the people who think season 7 and 8 were waay below Walking Dead standarts and was starting to believe that the end of The Walking Dead might be closer than i thought just a few years ago. Back in season 6 every episode was an event for me, but as season 7 started to lose steam and with season 8 being a bit of a mess, the show started to feel just like another tv show, but now it feels like that passion for the show i felt never left. The trailer looked really good, but i cant even imagine a Walking Dead without Rick so im still holding onto hope.

All Out War thoughts?,"Hey! So I have been binge reading the comics for the past couple of months in preparation for season 9 and can I just say how amazing they are. I have never read a single issue but got hooked instantly and have just finished the All Out War issue. I can see why people favour the comics over the tv show especially because Andrea is such a bad ass! 

This might be an unpopular opinion but I prefer the All Out War storyline in the TV series than the comics. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the TV series has it‚Äôs problems and I‚Äôm not here to mock the comics because they are awesome. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on this. Most people seemed to hate what they did with the All Out War storyline in the TV series from what I have read? 

I felt like the comic arc seemed rushed and the transitions from scene to scene felt a bit odd. I don‚Äôt know if this is down to me watching the show first with the All Out War arc being dragged out over a couple of seasons. Like it seemed like they cut a few panels out in some issues which made it feel a bit awkward. Also some of the characters choices seemed to just come out of the blue and didn‚Äôt seem like they was in character or had any build up too it.

* Lydia is kidnapped around episode 9 by Michonne. We think Daryl is also with Michonne when the kidnapping takes place. Also heard they also might take another hostage besides Lydia too. There was mention that Daryl and Michonne start shooting at walkers to determine who‚Äôs a walker and who‚Äôs a Whisperer. But when they do this more walkers approach them and cause trouble. I think this is the same scene where they end up catching Lydia.
* Alpha also manages to get a hold of hostages as well. We were told she has two. We think one of them is Luke. We‚Äôve heard conflicting reports about the survival of these hostages.
* Alpha brings several Whisperers with her to the Hilltop and demands Lydia back in exchange for her hostages. (This should be in episode 11).
* Daryl eventually takes Lydia out to them and gives her back.
* Lots of walkers start approaching Hilltop. They are drawn by the sounds of a crying baby that supposedly belongs to one of the Whisperers.
* Alpha demands the Whisperer to leave the baby since it‚Äôs attracting walkers. The Whisperer obeys and puts the baby on the ground and they leave.
* Connie runs out and rescues the baby.
* Still not clear if the hostages that Alpha had were successfully exchanged or if they die.
* Also conflicting reports regarding Beta‚Äôs status. We first heard he was captured along with Lydia. Then we later heard he was with Alpha when she goes to Hilltop to retrieve Lydia.",1,"TSDF: New Spoilers

How I hope Rick's departure goes down,"(Apologies in advance for the super-long post. Also, I'm on mobile, so double apologies if the formatting is weird.)

We know that episode 5 is supposedly going to be Rick's final episode, and that his death/departure has something to do with a horde of Walkers surrounding him. Based solely on that, the trailer, and official information that's been released, I've finally decided on how I want Rick to die/leave - or, at the very least, this is how I would handle it if I were in charge. (Note that I haven't read anything from TSDF other than the vague stuff I've already mentioned). 

So we know that the Bridge that they're building is going to play a major role in the season, based on trailers and the fact that the second episode is literally called ""The Bridge."" We also know that members of the Saviors are going to be rebelling against Rick and the other communities. If I recall correctly, Zach McGowan's character is a Savior, and is sort of leading the rebellion against Rick.

So in episode 5, the Saviors have managed to lure Rick, Daryl, Carol etc. to the Bridge (we see several shots in the trailer of a bunch of major characters at the Bridge). In my version, the Saviors have herded a massive horde of Walkers in the direction of the Bridge, which would in turn lead them to Alexandria/the other communities. Their plan is to lure them across the Bridge and then remotely blow the Bridge up with explosives. Toward the end of episode 5, the entire group has realized that a massive horde is heading straight for the Bridge, and head towards it to see just how big it is, if they can redirect it, etc - all except Rick, who notices Zach McGowan's character (who I'll henceforth refer to as Zach) alone on the Bridge. As Zach has been leading the Savior rebellion, Rick confronts him. He discovers Zach has hooked up explosives to the Bridge. Zach pulls a gun on Rick, and Rick tries to get him to calm down, and to hand over the gun and remote detonator. He gives him the typical ""we can still come back"" speech we've heard many times before, except this time we see Rick actually reaching for his gun, and realize Rick is planning on killing Zach. Unfortunately, Rick gets one step too close, and Zach shoots Rick in the stomach, before Rick shoots him several times in the chest/head.

Rick collapses to his knees, clutching his side (in the same place he was injured in the pilot episode). This is where the shot in the trailer of Rick on the ground and the entire group running towards him comes in.

Daryl stops and he and Rick have a brief exchange, quickly wrapping up their conflict that we saw lots of in the trailer. After their exchange, they all run off as the Walker Horde heads straight for Rick + the Bridge. After everyone else is off the Bridge, Rick grabs Zach's remote detonator. Here is where we see the shot of Rick limping along and blood dripping from his stomach.

Rick stands on one end of the Bridge, and waits until all of the Walkers are on it with him. We see a close-up shot of Rick's eyes closing, and then - either one of two things happen.

If Rick does indeed die, then he blows himself, the Walkers and the Bridge up, and we see the explosion from a distance with Daryl and the others.

But, if he doesn't die and his fate is left unknown - which is obviously the version I prefer - then this happens: we see the close-up of Rick's eyes closing, and then, the soft sound of distant helicopter blades. They get louder and louder. Rick opens his eyes just before the screen cuts to black, and then we either hear the explosion, or we see it with the rest of the group like in Version #1, except this time, Rick's fate is left unknown, as perhaps the approaching helicopter did pick him up in time.

Fast-forward to the Season 9 finale. Negan has long since escaped his cell. The heads on pikes have already happened, either also in the finale, or (preferably) earlier in the season, like the mid-season finale. For the final scene of the season, we cut to the gates of Alexandria. A stranger enters the town, as the streets bustle with hundreds of people. We don't see the Stranger's face, only his back, and his extremely tattered clothes. The people of Alexandria begin to notice him, and soon, a circle has formed around him. Daryl, Carol and a couple others emerge from the circle to see the stranger.

It's Rick. He's got a giant-ass beard (the length he had in Carl's visions in Season 8, if not longer). You could even have him be blind in one eye, the same eye that Carl was missing, as a callback. The camera zooms in, the music swells, and when it cuts out, he says, ""Where's Negan?"" Cut to black, end season.

Why does he say ""Where's Negan?"" In the trailer, Negan tells Rick to ""come back and tell him about that date"", referring to the day when everything he's built goes wrong, or something along those lines. Now he has returned to do so, although of course by now Negan has escaped. 

The bigger question is, why did Rick wait so long to come back? Well, the cold open of the Season 10 premiere would reveal that the helicopter does indeed belong to the Commonwealth, and at first, he stayed there because he had to heal. After he's healed, at first he tries to leave, but eventually decides that he doesn't want to. Why? In the trailer, we see pretty much everyone turning against him. Why would he want to return to a place where everyone hates him, especially since Carl is dead? As for Judith, he trusts Michonne will take care of her. All of this would either be revealed in the cold open of the Season 10 premiere, or in a Rick standalone/flashback episode (probably episode 4 or 5 of the season) which would reveal the Commonwealth. You could even start the episode with him waking up from a coma, mirroring the pilot (in this version, Season 10 would be the final season).

Again, sorry for the length of the post, but I just had to get all my thoughts out there. I know there's a super big chance Rick is going to die, but whatever, dreaming is free. And if he does die, I hope they go with the version I mentioned here, or something close to it.",1,"How I hope Rick's departure goes down (Apologies in advance for the super-long post. Also, I'm on mobile, so double apologies if the formatting is weird.)

We know that episode 5 is supposedly going to be Rick's final episode, and that his death/departure has something to do with a horde of Walkers surrounding him. Based solely on that, the trailer, and official information that's been released, I've finally decided on how I want Rick to die/leave - or, at the very least, this is how I would handle it if I were in charge. (Note that I haven't read anything from TSDF other than the vague stuff I've already mentioned). 

So we know that the Bridge that they're building is going to play a major role in the season, based on trailers and the fact that the second episode is literally called ""The Bridge."" We also know that members of the Saviors are going to be rebelling against Rick and the other communities. If I recall correctly, Zach McGowan's character is a Savior, and is sort of leading the rebellion against Rick.

So in episode 5, the Saviors have managed to lure Rick, Daryl, Carol etc. to the Bridge (we see several shots in the trailer of a bunch of major characters at the Bridge). In my version, the Saviors have herded a massive horde of Walkers in the direction of the Bridge, which would in turn lead them to Alexandria/the other communities. Their plan is to lure them across the Bridge and then remotely blow the Bridge up with explosives. Toward the end of episode 5, the entire group has realized that a massive horde is heading straight for the Bridge, and head towards it to see just how big it is, if they can redirect it, etc - all except Rick, who notices Zach McGowan's character (who I'll henceforth refer to as Zach) alone on the Bridge. As Zach has been leading the Savior rebellion, Rick confronts him. He discovers Zach has hooked up explosives to the Bridge. Zach pulls a gun on Rick, and Rick tries to get him to calm down, and to hand over the gun and remote detonator. He gives him the typical ""we can still come back"" speech we've heard many times before, except this time we see Rick actually reaching for his gun, and realize Rick is planning on killing Zach. Unfortunately, Rick gets one step too close, and Zach shoots Rick in the stomach, before Rick shoots him several times in the chest/head.

Rick collapses to his knees, clutching his side (in the same place he was injured in the pilot episode). This is where the shot in the trailer of Rick on the ground and the entire group running towards him comes in.

Daryl stops and he and Rick have a brief exchange, quickly wrapping up their conflict that we saw lots of in the trailer. After their exchange, they all run off as the Walker Horde heads straight for Rick + the Bridge. After everyone else is off the Bridge, Rick grabs Zach's remote detonator. Here is where we see the shot of Rick limping along and blood dripping from his stomach.

Rick stands on one end of the Bridge, and waits until all of the Walkers are on it with him. We see a close-up shot of Rick's eyes closing, and then - either one of two things happen.

If Rick does indeed die, then he blows himself, the Walkers and the Bridge up, and we see the explosion from a distance with Daryl and the others.

But, if he doesn't die and his fate is left unknown - which is obviously the version I prefer - then this happens: we see the close-up of Rick's eyes closing, and then, the soft sound of distant helicopter blades. They get louder and louder. Rick opens his eyes just before the screen cuts to black, and then we either hear the explosion, or we see it with the rest of the group like in Version #1, except this time, Rick's fate is left unknown, as perhaps the approaching helicopter did pick him up in time.

Fast-forward to the Season 9 finale. Negan has long since escaped his cell. The heads on pikes have already happened, either also in the finale, or (preferably) earlier in the season, like the mid-season finale. For the final scene of the season, we cut to the gates of Alexandria. A stranger enters the town, as the streets bustle with hundreds of people. We don't see the Stranger's face, only his back, and his extremely tattered clothes. The people of Alexandria begin to notice him, and soon, a circle has formed around him. Daryl, Carol and a couple others emerge from the circle to see the stranger.

It's Rick. He's got a giant-ass beard (the length he had in Carl's visions in Season 8, if not longer). You could even have him be blind in one eye, the same eye that Carl was missing, as a callback. The camera zooms in, the music swells, and when it cuts out, he says, ""Where's Negan?"" Cut to black, end season.

Why does he say ""Where's Negan?"" In the trailer, Negan tells Rick to ""come back and tell him about that date"", referring to the day when everything he's built goes wrong, or something along those lines. Now he has returned to do so, although of course by now Negan has escaped.

Idea for an anthrology spinoff series.,"If they want to continue this universe for another decade then they need to change it up. An anthrology series would be perfect!

Every season is a different setting, stories, themes, etc. All seasons would exist in the same universe but they would each take place in different time periods after the end of the world.

Season 1 would be stories set during the collapse of society and could have an overall theme of humanity changing from an era of prosperity and decadence, to a premodern world.

The next season would take place right after the collapse and so on. Eventually by like season 10, it would be a century or more later but still be the universe.

The idea is, after the series finishes, the seasons could be watched as a documentary of human history during and after the zombie apocalypse.

Rough TWD logo idea.,,1,
TSDF: S9 Characters Descriptions,"**Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln):** At the end of last season, Rick unexpectedly let Negan live, and he stands by this decision in the name of his son. His goal is not simply to survive, it's to build the future Carl envisioned for this post-apocalyptic world. He is determined to see this through, but he's no longer the only voice of leadership, and not everyone agrees on the path forward. The war may be over, but the struggle for peace is just the beginning.

**Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus):**  One thing certain about Daryl is he is true to his word. He made a promise to Maggie at the end of last season, a promise he intends to keep. Daryl is skeptical of Rick's belief that peace between the communities is sustainable. He is trying to help Rick for the sake of their future, but their differing philosophies is only widening the rift in their brotherhood.

**Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan):** Life is good for Maggie. Time has passed. She gave birth to a happy and healthy baby boy. She is a natural at being a mom, just as she is at leading Hilltop. But even though her community is thriving, Negan continues to live in the shadows of her mind. Healing is a matter of time, but sometimes is a matter of opportunity. Maggie has been biding her time, waiting for her opportunity. She is not asking permission or seeking approval for any of her decisions. She will do what she thinks is necessary without hesitations, regardless of the cost.

**Michonne (Danai Gurira):** Michonne is leading Alexandria side by side with Rick. While Rick is taking on the practical and physical challenges necessary to make Carl's vision of the future a reality, Michonne focuses on the philosophical ideals by which all the communities may govern and prosper independently and as a whole. Both are important, and both present fundamental challenges that catch them unprepared. When things take an unexpected turn, the tightrope she walks to ensure a lawful and safe future becomes even more precarious.

**Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride):** With her heart on her sleeve and a weapon on her hand, Carol has found a new happiness, but remains as resilient as ever. She believes in Rick's vision and is loyal to her group and extended family, even when they come down on opposite sides. At the same time, if anyone dares to threaten her or someone she loves, there will be hell to pay.

**Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan):** To many living at Alexandria, Negan is the monster in the basement. He misses Lucille and is eager to see her again. A pathological manipulator, Negan subtly needles his rare visitors towards a desired path in order to orchestrate his master plan, holding his endgame close to his chest.

**Tara Chambler (Alanna Masterson):** Never one to hide from a fight or a good joke in the time of need, Tara is finding more strength and security in her own voice. She isn't afraid to stand up for what she believes is right, even if that puts her at odds with people she has always admired and respected. She is all too familiar with loss. That makes her appreciate today and grateful at the thought of tomorrow, sharing it with those around her - should they all be so lucky.

**Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt):** Eugene is determined to make up for his past selfish actions and is slowly gaining back his group's lost trust. In this time of relative peace, he is using his intelligence to bridge the communities together. But with peace never long for this world, will Eugene stand up or cower down the next time his people are in danger?

**Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos):** Rosita is a soldier in civilian clothes. But with the war over, she finds herself exploring a semi-normal life full of potential, and even love. She's come around to trusting Eugene again and is invested in the communities. She wants and works towards fully realizing the future Rick envisions.

**Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam):** Despite being blind in one eye, Father Gabriel is seeing himself and his place in the world more clearly than ever before. Once content living in self-imposed isolation, he's now pushing himself to explore new challenges and relationships, and encouraging others to do the same. He finds navigating this new path may require taking a leap of faith he never could have imagined.

**Aaron (Ross Marquand):** Aaron had to learn how to re-navigate the world following Eric's death. After facing another sudden tragedy, he has to figure out how to re-navigate it all over again - all while raising his daughter, Gracie. As he tries to provide the best possible future for her, he discovers that Rick's commitment to unite the communities, while well-intentioned, may be harder to achieve than he thought.

**Enid (Katelyn Nacon):** Enid is no longer just surviving somehow. She is helping the communities work toward a better future. What's more, she's learning medicine from Siddiq, well on her way to becoming a doctor in her own right. When she finds herself facing a medical crisis head on, she must rely on her skill, resolve and compassion to keep the people she cares about alive.

**Jesus (Tom Payne):** As Maggie's right-hand man at Hilltop, Jesus is her voice of reason and understanding, even if they don't always agree. As Maggie's determination grows, so does his role at Hilltop. Following his own code of inclusiveness, Jesus leads by example.

**Gregory (Xander Berkeley):** Time has mellowed Gregory, who is now towing the line at Hilltop and obediently following Maggie's lead. It will take a true test of his selflessness to convince those around him that he's not the man he used to be.

**King Ezekiel (Khary Payton):** Ezekiel remains King of the Kingdom and a father to Henry. Following the events of the war, he is now revered just as much through his actions as a man as through his pomp and circumstance as a king. The Kingdom is still struggling from the events of last season, but Ezekiel's eyes are on the sparrow, hoping for a prosperous and fair future for all the communities.

**Anne/Jadis (Pollyana McIntosh):** Despite her best efforts, Anne (formerly Jadis) finds that assimilating into her new life as an Alexandrian is more challenging than she'd hoped. She's trying her best to look forward, but fears it might be a matter of time before her past catches up with her.

**Alden (Callan McAuliffe):** A fierce supporter of Maggie, Alden is instrumental in the success of Hilltop. While he no longers considers himself a Savior, he still looks out for the interests of those still living at the Sanctuary, advocating for their safety and well being.

**Siddiq (Avi Nash):** Last season, Siddiq was the outsider Carl brought in. This season, he's not only a respected community member, but also Rick and Michonne's close friend and confidant. He is teaching medicine to Enid and others, with the goal of spreading knowledgeable medical personnel throughout the various communities. Siddiq is acutely aware that Carl sacrificed his life to bring him in, so it's important to him that he do his part in keeping Carl's vision of the future alive.",1,"TSDF: S9 Characters Descriptions **Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln):** At the end of last season, Rick unexpectedly let Negan live, and he stands by this decision in the name of his son. His goal is not simply to survive, it's to build the future Carl envisioned for this post-apocalyptic world. He is determined to see this through, but he's no longer the only voice of leadership, and not everyone agrees on the path forward. The war may be over, but the struggle for peace is just the beginning.

**Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus):**  One thing certain about Daryl is he is true to his word. He made a promise to Maggie at the end of last season, a promise he intends to keep. Daryl is skeptical of Rick's belief that peace between the communities is sustainable. He is trying to help Rick for the sake of their future, but their differing philosophies is only widening the rift in their brotherhood.

**Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan):** Life is good for Maggie. Time has passed. She gave birth to a happy and healthy baby boy. She is a natural at being a mom, just as she is at leading Hilltop. But even though her community is thriving, Negan continues to live in the shadows of her mind. Healing is a matter of time, but sometimes is a matter of opportunity. Maggie has been biding her time, waiting for her opportunity. She is not asking permission or seeking approval for any of her decisions. She will do what she thinks is necessary without hesitations, regardless of the cost.

**Michonne (Danai Gurira):** Michonne is leading Alexandria side by side with Rick. While Rick is taking on the practical and physical challenges necessary to make Carl's vision of the future a reality, Michonne focuses on the philosophical ideals by which all the communities may govern and prosper independently and as a whole. Both are important, and both present fundamental challenges that catch them unprepared. When things take an unexpected turn, the tightrope she walks to ensure a lawful and safe future becomes even more precarious.

**Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride):** With her heart on her sleeve and a weapon on her hand, Carol has found a new happiness, but remains as resilient as ever. She believes in Rick's vision and is loyal to her group and extended family, even when they come down on opposite sides. At the same time, if anyone dares to threaten her or someone she loves, there will be hell to pay.

**Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan):** To many living at Alexandria, Negan is the monster in the basement. He misses Lucille and is eager to see her again. A pathological manipulator, Negan subtly needles his rare visitors towards a desired path in order to orchestrate his master plan, holding his endgame close to his chest.

**Tara Chambler (Alanna Masterson):** Never one to hide from a fight or a good joke in the time of need, Tara is finding more strength and security in her own voice. She isn't afraid to stand up for what she believes is right, even if that puts her at odds with people she has always admired and respected. She is all too familiar with loss. That makes her appreciate today and grateful at the thought of tomorrow, sharing it with those around her - should they all be so lucky.

**Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt):** Eugene is determined to make up for his past selfish actions and is slowly gaining back his group's lost trust. In this time of relative peace, he is using his intelligence to bridge the communities together. But with peace never long for this world, will Eugene stand up or cower down the next time his people are in danger?

**Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos):** Rosita is a soldier in civilian clothes. But with the war over, she finds herself exploring a semi-normal life full of potential, and even love. She's come around to trusting Eugene again and is invested in the communities. She wants and works towards fully realizing the future Rick envisions.

**Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam):** Despite being blind in one eye, Father Gabriel is seeing himself and his place in the world more clearly than ever before. Once content living in self-imposed isolation, he's now pushing himself to explore new challenges and relationships, and encouraging others to do the same. He finds navigating this new path may require taking a leap of faith he never could have imagined.

**Aaron (Ross Marquand):** Aaron had to learn how to re-navigate the world following Eric's death. After facing another sudden tragedy, he has to figure out how to re-navigate it all over again - all while raising his daughter, Gracie. As he tries to provide the best possible future for her, he discovers that Rick's commitment to unite the communities, while well-intentioned, may be harder to achieve than he thought.

**Enid (Katelyn Nacon):** Enid is no longer just surviving somehow. She is helping the communities work toward a better future. What's more, she's learning medicine from Siddiq, well on her way to becoming a doctor in her own right. When she finds herself facing a medical crisis head on, she must rely on her skill, resolve and compassion to keep the people she cares about alive.

**Jesus (Tom Payne):** As Maggie's right-hand man at Hilltop, Jesus is her voice of reason and understanding, even if they don't always agree. As Maggie's determination grows, so does his role at Hilltop. Following his own code of inclusiveness, Jesus leads by example.

**Gregory (Xander Berkeley):** Time has mellowed Gregory, who is now towing the line at Hilltop and obediently following Maggie's lead. It will take a true test of his selflessness to convince those around him that he's not the man he used to be.

**King Ezekiel (Khary Payton):** Ezekiel remains King of the Kingdom and a father to Henry. Following the events of the war, he is now revered just as much through his actions as a man as through his pomp and circumstance as a king. The Kingdom is still struggling from the events of last season, but Ezekiel's eyes are on the sparrow, hoping for a prosperous and fair future for all the communities.

**Anne/Jadis (Pollyana McIntosh):** Despite her best efforts, Anne (formerly Jadis) finds that assimilating into her new life as an Alexandrian is more challenging than she'd hoped. She's trying her best to look forward, but fears it might be a matter of time before her past catches up with her.

**Alden (Callan McAuliffe):** A fierce supporter of Maggie, Alden is instrumental in the success of Hilltop. While he no longers considers himself a Savior, he still looks out for the interests of those still living at the Sanctuary, advocating for their safety and well being.

"Asked about the weaker ratings for AMC hit show The Walking Dead, [AMC's CEO] argued the popular series was more of a franchise.",,1,
My TWD rewrite/reboot/adaptation,"I‚Äôm sure we can all agree that the show was exceptional up until the end of Season 5, arguably the end of Season 6 - it was the following two seasons (along with several poor choices even before them) that lead to the show‚Äôs massive decrease in popularity, and I think that with the benefit of hindsight the show could be a lot better.


Here is how i‚Äôd personally have adapted the comics into a similarly styled show - firstly, i‚Äôd cut down the number of episodes per season to 12 to give each one a succinct and compact plot, but also allowing for an overarching plot.
I‚Äôd also stay mostly faithful to the comics (more-so adding my own stuff than detracting) but i‚Äôd also keep the tone of the comics, so we don‚Äôt get any weird translation issues like Shiva in the show.

How long are the mid-season breaks?,"I always find the mid-season break annoying.  This year, I'm just going to PVR up the episodes and not start watching until I can just continue as if the break isn't there.

Can anyone remember how long the breaks usually are?  Or, to put it another way, assuming I watch the episodes weekly, and the premiere is October 7th, when should I start watching so I don't have to wait out the break?  Mid-November?

The CGI Deer wasn't (and still isn't) that big of a deal,"It wasn't good CGI. I agree with that. But people were acting like the Walking Dead had included a truly unforgivable, depraved scene with how angry the one scene made people. True, there was also the issue in a previous episode that season with the CGI background while Rick was on top of the trash pile (AKA the ""Up, Up, Up""). But not only was the deer a very minor scene as opposed to something like Shiva (which was undeniably AMAZING CGI), people also seem to forget that, aside from a few rich jerks at AMC taking the millions the show has for its budget, a lot of money has to be spent in more prominent areas.

For example, walker make-up, make-up artists, walker CGI, fake blood and guts, fake weapons, stunt doubles, stunt props, cameras, animals (horses, dogs, etc.), animal tamers, clothing, lighting, musical soundtrack, extra background actors, walker auditions (which are a real thing), refreshments for the cast and crew (which includes hundreds of people roasting in walker make-up in the Georgian summer sun), filming rights, vehicles, security, set maintenance, setting scouts (again, a real thing), and rights to existing pieces of music (""Someday We'll All Be Free"", ""Town Called Malice"", ""Easy Street"", etc.), just to name a few things each episode requires the makers to spend money on. Multiply that by sixteen, and it makes a single season a pretty costly product for a cable show.

I understand why the deer scene received negative feedback, but not to the level that it did. I've never seen any other show get so much crap for such a small upset, with a large emphasis on 'small'.",1,"The CGI Deer wasn't (and still isn't) that big of a deal It wasn't good CGI.

The Future of Society in The Walking Dead Universe?,"Do you think that eventually, after many years, possibly decades, that society will be rebuilt in the world of The Walking Dead? Perhaps a cure will be found? Or maybe the dead will be so heavily regulated that society could be kept in check? Or maybe somehow the virus disappears altogether? Do you think there might be future historians in The Walking Dead universe will see people like Rick Grimes and Negan like local tribal leaders who fought against one another? I'd like to think Negan and the Saviors would be seen as conquerors, and that places like the Kingdom and Alexandria would be seen as vassal states under the control of the Savors until eventually they rebelled under the leadership of clan leader Rick Grimes. There might potentially be many other examples of this throughout the world, and the war between the Saviors and their vassal states would maybe somehow become most famous, even if it's not the largest in scale.

I hated that moment because it messes up the move Negan will use for the future. Do you think they‚Äôll still use that for the show?

EDIT: You‚Äôre all awesome for the input. They probably still will use it , but the slip-up will forever haunt me. 21 days until the new season!"

Question about the comics [Comic Spoilers],"So firstoff, I have not read the comics yet. I plan on it eventually, but probably not for a little while to be honest. Being the way that the internet works, I‚Äôm not concerned about spoiling anything. I know a decent amount about how the war plays out, as well as most of the differences between what we‚Äôve seen so far and what actually happens in the comics. I‚Äôm also familiar with the ‚Äútime jump‚Äù we‚Äôre supposedly getting and what that all means. 

My question: I‚Äôve seen it mentioned here or there that there is a 2nd Negan lineup in the comics after the one that took out Glenn, and what we got in the 7 finale with Rick and Carl is the show‚Äôs version of that. From what I‚Äôve seen, it was extremely watered down and whatnot. However, I haven‚Äôt been able to find too much taking about how the comic one went down. 

Can anybody give me a good description of the comic version? Obviously some pictures of the panels may help as well.

"How many people does Alexandria, Hilltop, and Kingdom have vs. Negan's army?","In S7E9, Rick said its not enough people with hilltop and alexandria alone. When he goes to the kingdom, his face lights up and says ""they got the numbers"".

Im hoping someone could help clarify this. 

Alexandria has sustained heavy loses since the beginning of season 6. It looks like theres only 20 people there after the wolves attack, the big herd that followed their attack, plus negan/garbage people attack. Am i right?

Same with hilltop. Looks like 20-25 people living in an area that looks smaller than Alexandria.

Now, Kingdom looks like at least 100 people minimum. Soldiers and civilians combined.

So maybe combined they are like... Err... 150 total maybe?

Negan looks like he might have 200-250 saviors left. Team Family already killed about 70 of them so far and Negan still has more than enough left.

On a side note.. The heapsters... No clue. I counted at least 50 of them at the season 7 finale.

"I actually really liked 7x3, The Cell.","Sorry for being a music noob, but this episode introduced me to ""Town Called Malice"", ""Easy Street"", and ""Crying"". I love all three songs in different ways. 

Also, I thought the interactions between Daryl, Negan, and Dwight were well done. 

We get to see Daryl in a weak state yet also be a badass by not flinching to Lucille as well as not calling himself Negan. It gives us hope that Daryl will stay tough and retaliate when he gets a good chance. Daryl really didn't even break although he had a shitty experience. 

In 6x16 and 7x1, Negan was a brutal evil maniac. He still is, but in 7x3 we see a more charismatic, funny, and sarcastic side of him. We also see his dynamic with the Saviors, as he is portrayed to be their king. 

So yeah, good and underrated episode overall imo.

[SPOILERS]Symbolism of the chess board that Governor played with that little girl,"When the little girl painted an eyepatch over the Governor over the white king and said it looked like him and the Governor told the girl that even if the pawns are dead she doesn't lose like when the Governor didn't care about sacrificing his henchmen there is symbolism of the Governor and his crew relating to the chess pieces. 

King: Governor
Queen: Andrea
Bishop: Milton
Rook: Merle
Knight: Martinez
Pawns: His other henchmen like the ones he just shot dead (sacrificed)

Their personalities and traits seem similar to the pieces. Andrea like the Queen can get around from one side of the enemy to back to her allies freely. Merle had a very straightforward and aggressive approach like the Rook, Milton was the intelligence using subtle means to do things too bad he betrays Governor, Martinez is used sort of like a sergeant. Governor like the king has a subtle, slow and steady approach of dealing with his enemies and only if he was killed would the madness end. There's been four instances the Governor was ""checked"" but they didn't go through which commonly happens in a game of chess.

Michonne could of killed him
Andrea could of killed him
Rick could of killed him
Martinze could of killed him",1,"[SPOILERS]Symbolism of the chess board that Governor played with that little girl When the little girl painted an eyepatch over the Governor over the white king and said it looked like him and the Governor told the girl that even if the pawns are dead she doesn't lose like when the Governor didn't care about sacrificing his henchmen there is symbolism of the Governor and his crew relating to the chess pieces.

So we know that negan kinda captured Gabriel, and it reminds me the scene from the comics where holly decides to Break the sanctuary gate (rick try to stop her but fail) and the same thing happen! (she gets caught) 
i thought about that because in 4:04 (trailer) we can see the walkers walking on the gate.

Maybe it's because The Walking Dead has ben pretty dissapointing in Season 6 and 7 or simply because the staff does a good job on FTWD Season 3 but it's really entertaining.  
  
the main center of TWD is obviously Rick and his son but in The Walking Dead it feels like the main cast is much bigger, talking about screentime.

Dying from a zombie in the Walking Dead is the dumbest way to die,"Like, there's literally no real way a healthy, mobile person should ever get killed or infected by a zombie. I would understand if the walkers were like the zombies in 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead where they run fast at you, but Walking Dead zombies shamble around while making loud noises, so unless you're a blind deaf paraplegic then you should never die from a walker. You don't even have to fight a walker to stay alive. Here's a good strategy; every time a walker takes one step towards you, you take two steps back.

 Hell, it's even hard to get infected; apparently you could rub rotting zombie blood and guts all over your face and body and still not die from infection somehow.",1,"Dying from a zombie in the Walking Dead is the dumbest way to die Like, there's literally no real way a healthy, mobile person should ever get killed or infected by a zombie.

My girlfriend and I disagree pretty strongly on Simon. Could y'all settle this for us?,"Okay, so my girlfriend and I have vastly differing views on Simon, and she thinks I'm crazy for how *I* view him, so I need an outside opinion:

Once I watched the season 6 finale, where he tells Rick to appreciate those around him, and to treat them kind, because it could be their last day on Earth, and while that's clearly a threat, I took it as a sign of compassion, because there was no way they were getting out of the jam they were in. I honestly think he wasn't trying to scare them as much as he was trying to let them know, in a compassionate way, that someone was going to die, and there was no way to change that. 

Also, every incident involving him afterwards, he was just being realistic with whomever he was dealing with, and while he took some liberties (getting a bottle of alcohol for himself), he was being pretty damn reasonable for the most part.

My girlfriend thinks he's just sadistic, and overtly enjoys inflicting pain.

He's pretty much just Alexandria's sentry at the moment, but I think it's past time that he takes a more active role in the season. Seth Gilliam is also a damn fine actor and a completion of a character arc for Gabriel has the potential to be one of the better remembered aspects of the show. ",1,"A Gabriel centric episode?

Season's 7 problems (and hope for the future),"Im a big fan of the comics and I enjoy the show, and I recently just caught up with season 7. 

I will continue to avidly follow both, but the show has a real problem of having everything be shitty for all the characters in the bigger picture. I like the smaller character moments that the show has. But seriously, there is no tension knowing that every thing that seems sinister will be sinister. The characters come off as dumb because the actions they take and the people they trust are so fucking obviously wrong. This is a problem for the show-runners. Acting and directing is all superb but I can only take so much of the stupid decisions and even bigger consequences. 

I know the saviors are supposed to be this type of villain, but there has to be a direct correlation for this type of shitty suspense and the show's drop-off. 
Season 8 bringing All Out War will alleviate many of these issues, but seriously, S7 was 16 episodes of drawn out bullshit.",1,"Season's 7 problems (and hope for the future) Im a big fan of the comics and I enjoy the show, and I recently just caught up with season 7.

[SPOILERS] Really Carl?,"I just got done watching all of season 7 in one day, I'm caught up but I have a concern...



I know people say this time to time about the group actions should be better, but one stuck out to me. When Carl is found by the savior in the food truck, he shoots the savior and kills one outside. He killed 2 men, congrats. But Negan comes into his view and he starts talking.

I understand shock and everything but he just killed 2 people, and the ruler of them is standing there without a gun out, why didn't Carl just shoot? Why did Carl take his time listening to him? He just stood there until Dwayne jumped him and took his gun. 

This happens throughout the series, it's basically predictable. Find the ultimate ruler of a enemy team, point you gun at him/her, listen to them talk until somebody attacks them, and now you have half a season more trying to get this guy.

I love the show so much, my favourite show next to Family Guy, but can somebody elaborate why Carl didn't shoot?


",1,"[SPOILERS] Really Carl? I just got done watching all of season 7 in one day, I'm caught up but I have a concern...



I know people say this time to time about the group actions should be better, but one stuck out to me. When Carl is found by the savior in the food truck, he shoots the savior and kills one outside. He killed 2 men, congrats. But Negan comes into his view and he starts talking.

I understand shock and everything but he just killed 2 people, and the ruler of them is standing there without a gun out, why didn't Carl just shoot? Why did Carl take his time listening to him? He just stood there until Dwayne jumped him and took his gun.

"First time watcher, my thoughts... [Pilot Episode]","So after months, even years, of procrastinating, I finally decided to watch The Walking Dead. I've been pestered time and time again by some to give it a chance but have been turned off by others saying it has shotty writing, boring characters, poor acting, dumb plot devices, too much gore, too little gore, and pretty much that it's a satirical take on the zombie genre. I'm a huge George Romero fan and love Night of the Living Dead especially, and was told that the zombies are ridiculously different (which is fine, the film was made 50 years ago and evolution takes a toll on things). Also a fan of Zombieland even thought that was a comedy in most facets, so I've come to consider myself a fan of zombies.

I've watched Game of Thrones which is another media titan and I've heard that it's comparable in a lot of ways, which would be good because I believe it's some of the best TV I've watched... ever.

This all being said, I'm essentially just going to watch the episode and write down my thoughts as I go, so first notes are going to be rough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**FIRST NOTES:**

- liking the setting, really gives off the feel of ""desolation""

- HOOOOOOLY SHIT. That opener was amazing. The prosthetics make-up (you could see the bloody drool!!!), the event, everything about it. A show has balls to show a grown man and a cop, nonetheless, shooting a little girl undead or not in the forehead like that.

- I dig the music of the intro (even though I've heard it a time or two from other places)

- JON BERNTHALLLLLLLL!!! I saw him in Baby Driver and The Accountant and love his acting. I know this show is keen on killing people but I truly hope he's around for a while at least.

- so I've learned the name of this guy's son, Carl, and wife, Laurie, before I know his.

- update: found out his name is Rick only after he gets shot

- that was a pretty damn intense scene, show's giving a pretty decent impression thus far

- ""reverend Shane"" seems like an incredibly caring friend which is a real contrast from other things I've seen Bernthal in

- was there some delayed sense of time that Rick's unconscious mind remembered? Those flowers were dead and he responded to Shane as if it were a few seconds later.

- hospital bed in front of an otherwise vacant and lifeless place. A little coincidental...

- there's that feel of desolation again! Rick's face when he sees that woman torn to pieces on the ground made me actually fear for what would happen next.

- ""Don't Dead Open Inside"".... now I know where the meme comes from

- all of those bodies lined in an essential order without care makes me wonder if the government will be behind the facilitation of the epidemic

- why didn't you take off in one of the helicopters?!?!?!

- the zombie torn in half with entrails leaking out already shows that the make-up effects on this show are top notch. Quite possibly one of the best zombies I've seen.

- what an emotional ride for this guy, Laurie and Carl aren't home (and probably dead), his partner is probably dead too, he's shot and I'm assuming that he's not fully recovered, the world is ending as he knows it, no life forms of any kind nearby... might wanna just go make some good company with half-woman

- life form located! This guy just can't get a break. Add broken nose to the list above ^

- ""you shot that man""... are you daft? Have you never *seen* Night of the Living Dead?

- the fact that the black guy has distinctive terminology for zombies makes me think that it's been weeks since the epidemic started... how did Rick survive that long without any maintenance and the state he was in?

- ""she's here"" that Dwayne said made me think it was a hybrid zombie like the Tank or something from Left 4 Dead... I guess this is really the first zombie media to really delve incredibly far into emotional side

- good detective work with the photo album thing lol, I guess he does make for a decent officer

- why wouldn't Dwayne and his father go with Rick regardless of gun training? 

- a few clicks later I found out why... guess I shouldn't question before the cards are all in my hand 

- Shane is still alive.... nice.

- here's the ""bitch that supposedly can't turn the lights off""

- OH SHIT, it's the bitch that _CAN_ turn the lights off

- ""forgive us"", what an ominous undertone

- this looks exactly like downtown Atlanta... did they shut down streets?

- ANOTHER HELICOPTER, TAKE IT DUDE!

- that tank works too FYI

- GET IN THE TANK AND BLOW THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS AWAY

- I was sure he was going to either die by the zombies or kill himself, I didn't even know tanks had an entrance underneath

- dude should have at least tried the gunner seat, didn't even take the effort

- ""Hey dumbass, yeah, you in the tank""... Will Rick get a break? Was he just a plot device used to show setting? Will he die and give Shane the main focus of the show? Find out next episode!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINAL THOUGHTS:**

Wow. That was a killer opening. To be honest I had mixed expectations going into it but the writing of this episode will hopefully be consistent with the entire series, because this was the make or break it for me. If I didn't like the pilot, I would have exited out of the webpage midway through this post without publishing it and you wouldn't be reading it right now. I was halfway joking about my last point in the ""First Notes"" section about Rick dying and Shane becoming the main character, but I've been told that characters are tossed left right and center on this show so I believe anything can happen... and I wouldn't be incredibly sad because Bernthal is great at what he does, but I haven't seen the guy who plays Rick in anything else. In regards to this episode alone, I feel like there was a great mix of suspense, horror, drama (Shane kissing Laurie!!!), and good payoff overall. 

Overall I'd give the episode a 9.5/10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**QUESTIONS:**

1. Did we ever learn the black guy's name? I might have missed it but I'm assuming it'd be important to know for the next episode. Wouldn't want to hear a random name I don't know thrown about.

2. Again, how did Rick survive weeks or maybe more without proper maintenance? 

3. Who is the make-up artist and what else have I seen him in? Those prosthetics were amazing.

4. How many episodes are in a season? I'd just Google all of this information but I don't want episode titles that would potentially spoil something for me.

5. Are most, if not all, episodes consistently this good? Are there any worth skipping because of little information? I did skip a few during GoT from friend's advice and was still offered the same stuff at the end of the seasons.

6. Was there any huge things that I missed? I pretty much put all that I caught into the notes.

7. Any trivia on the episode that wouldn't spoil other things for me? 

8. Should I update my findings by seasons? I don't want to litter my observations for every episode but I can make update posts on every season if need be.

[S7 SPOILERS] Season 8 questions?,"I was wondering, wouldn't a revolt of the Savior's oppressed settlements lead to a quick demise of the Saviors, given that Negan and friends depend heavily on resources stolen from the groups they control? The Saviors are a very large group, and the loss of all those weekly ""deliveries"" would be a huge blow to their resource intake. How can they sustain a war when they've essentially become addicted to an unstable supply source?

Maybe this is addressed in some way, but the whole thing doesn't seem viable. Saviors are not exempt from issues like these (aside from tv show logic). My only idea is that they have an emergency hoard of supplies created for reasons like war. Otherwise, they would be out of food/etc real quick.

Why did Rick and Governor want the prison so bad?," Realistically, Rick should have taken the deal Governor made. However, I'm not sure why Governor wants the prison so bad either.

‚Ä¢ Why Rick shouldn't want it: 
1. At this point, Governor has been at the prison 3 times, each with intentions or possible intentions to attack. If Rick and gang leave, they could possibly get away from Governor forever. 
2. That sickness is festering in that prison. They should want to leave to avoid that sickness.
3. It's been a grind to keep the walkers out.

Why the Governor shouldn't want it:
1.  Rick tells him a lot of sick people are there.
2. With all the violence that has happened there, it is just going to linger in Governor's mind, making him go crazy. 
3. Come on, his worst enemies are there. 
4. With all the bad stuff that has happened there, it just doesn't seem like a suitable place to move into. Instead they could try to go somewhere else

What characters do you think will make it to the very end ( or close to it)?,"Carl, Enid, Judith, and Maggie‚Äôs child are good bets for making it to the final episode. This point in the story is less about survival and more about rebuilding society and that‚Äôs what the younger characters are going to be able to do.  

I have a feeling Rick will go out very similar to the Lee and Clementine scene from the video games. 

Carol I feel like will live to the final season. Maybe not the last episode though. She‚Äôs become a fan favorite and the writers love her as well. Plus she has an amazing arc that I think will extend and end with her sacrificing herself to save these ‚Äúchildren‚Äù. Then her character will be full circle. 

Daryl will say around because he is the face of the show. If he does.. I hope they give him better storylines than they have recently. 

Maggie I can see living the whole series. She‚Äôll be the fierce leader who will raise and support all these kids to become great. 

Michonne, while a bad ass. I can see being killed off in the near future. Maybe not this season though.

[spoilers] If old characters were still alive today.,"I have had many conversations with a friend on how the Walking Dead would be different today if some of the old characters were still alive. It's always been a fun debate and thought this would be a great place to hear other people's opinions. 

It mostly revolves around the old characters interactions with the new ""vilified"" ones. As well as the directions the group could've taken differently. 

Some of the main situations I always think about is how guys like Merle would of interacted with Negan. Merle seemed to kind of (just a bit) soften up towards the end. And he could've possibly formed more of a bond (as best as Merle could) with the others in Rick and Co. His brutal no BS nature might have come in handy (although Abraham was kind of the same just not racist). 

Also of course there is Shane, he was crazy as hell and kept getting worse. His Lori situation was destined to be even a bigger disaster (if possible). But what if Rick and Shane sort of made up and Shane actually calmed the hell down? Between Shane and Merle the group might've came out better in the recent situations. 

I also get a laugh out of imagining the conversations between Merle and pretty much every new character since. Just think if he had met Negan and when Negan saw his blade hand what kind of exchanges they would've had.

Christian Serratos (Rosita) was my favorite part of Season 7...hear me out.,"She has the MOST natural way of delivering dialogue out of everyone on the show. Everyone else seems to overact. If it isn't the actors simply ""overacting"" than I would imagine it's the writing itself or the director allowing such melodramatic deliveries of said dialogue. I can't deny that someone like Andrew Lincoln can convey emotion very well, but even he is guilty of some line deliveries that seem forced. 

Everything that actress says actually sounds like the words of someone speaking in real life as opposed to a TV drama.

This show just leaves me feeling so empty and I wish it didn't.,"I watched the first 5 1/2 seasons religiously. Half way through the 5th season (and a little bit before that) I just lost so much interest in this show. Everything because so predictable and boring that I couldn't stand it and I completely stopped watching. Every episode was filled with boring, predictable situations where nothing happened until the last 2 minutes to let you drawn in for next week. 

Fast forward to present time: I'm scrolling through Netflix and I see a picture of Negan. I'm instantly drawn back into the show because I'm dying to know more about him. 

As im watching the end of 6 and beginning of 7, I'm absolutely in love with this show again. Most of season 7 had me hooked and I couldn't wait to see what would happen, who would die, and what Negan would do.

Just finished season 7 and once again I am completely underwhelmed. Forcing the junkyard people into the mix just didn't feel right. Having them turn on Ricks group was frustrating but it's all good. Then with every single member having a gun to the back of their head, a tiger attacks and all of the sudden every single person survives the attack? Oh boy oh boy here comes Hilltop and Ezekiel at the perfect time (how did they get in and no one noticed though?)

IDK. It seemed so cheesy, and at that point I just wanted them to continue it and kill Negan. But he ends up getting away and now we probably get to relive some other corny circumstance.

I really don't intend to hate on the show. I love it for the most part, but man I wish they didn't mess these important parts up ",1,"This show just leaves me feeling so empty and I wish it didn't.

[SPOILERS] Fan theory on certain strange occurrences.,"Over and over we've seen instances where a character has close encounters with people we (and usually they) know are dead. Rick with Lori, Daryl with Merle, the Governor appearing to Tyreese, and so on. We've seen instances of characters ""losing it"" like Rick talking to distant people on the phone. Through the consensus of his peers we are expected to think Rick really was on his way to losing his sanity, but what if Rick was not imagining those voices? What if the dead really were reaching out to him, as well as Lori herself way back when?

My theory is these scenes happen for a reason. They're not just artistic license but let's allow for three possible explanations for what these scenes are meant to show:

- As is initially implied, the living character experiencing these things is having a mental breakdown of sorts and the appearances of dead former characters is meant to show them stressing out over the recent awfulness that's happening to them. The living are imagining seeing their dead friends (or enemies) come back to haunt them briefly, or else are the welcoming committee for the afterlife, or some such, but it's just hallucinations, nothing more...

- These scenes are just a tribute to the character being focused on for that scene, in terms of old relationships with people now deceased. A fancy of way of having them see their life flash before their eyes, but it's not literally part of their story or the show itself. It's just artistic expression by the show producers, and is an instance of pushing on the fourth wall, but nothing in these scenes is actually happening...

- These scenes are meant to be taken literally; in other words, the dead really are appearing to the living as supernatural beings, but only when the living are alone by themselves.

Now I don't believe they are merely ""artistic license"", or an occasion of the writers wanting to break the fourth wall or do a tribute to a character that's on their way out. My theory is the spirits of the dead really are dropping in to say 'hi' to the living one last time, or are standing by to escort them to the next world. They are physically manifesting through some supernatural power and appearing in the material world either to comfort, encourage, or perhaps rebuke the the living for whatever reason.

Up until Season 6, these 'visions' had always happened in isolation. No one who lived on beyond having one of these visions is ever seen talking to another living person about experiencing the visitation, so it's quite vague what these scenes are supposed to be about.

But then, in Episode 11 of Season 6 (""Knots Untie""), one living character says something to another about [](/s seeing the dead as if they were right there, in the flesh). It seems like a minor throwaway line, just a little small talk, and if you aren't paying attention you miss it:

[](/s ""You okay, Freddie?"")

[](/s ""For a second back there, just when I thought he was gonna I saw my wife."")

[](/s ""She died before all this."")

[](/s ""Just when I thought it was over, there she was."")

[](/s ""-laughs- Clear as day."")

With just four lines, the first three interpretations are completely invalidated. In S6E11 we see someone confessing they've seen something that doesn't make sense in the literal sense, that is not a daydream, not wishful thinking; he literally saw what we saw and believes his eyes concerning it.

The question now becomes: [](/s ""not IF these scenes are actually happening, nor IF the living are actually being visited by the spirits of the dead, but HOW can the dead now visit the living, and WHY are they now allowed to do it?"")
",1,"[SPOILERS] Fan theory on certain strange occurrences. Over and over we've seen instances where a character has close encounters with people we (and usually they) know are dead. Rick with Lori, Daryl with Merle, the Governor appearing to Tyreese, and so on. We've seen instances of characters ""losing it"" like Rick talking to distant people on the phone. Through the consensus of his peers we are expected to think Rick really was on his way to losing his sanity, but what if Rick was not imagining those voices? What if the dead really were reaching out to him, as well as Lori herself way back when?

My theory is these scenes happen for a reason. They're not just artistic license but let's allow for three possible explanations for what these scenes are meant to show:

- As is initially implied, the living character experiencing these things is having a mental breakdown of sorts and the appearances of dead former characters is meant to show them stressing out over the recent awfulness that's happening to them. The living are imagining seeing their dead friends (or enemies) come back to haunt them briefly, or else are the welcoming committee for the afterlife, or some such, but it's just hallucinations, nothing more...

- These scenes are just a tribute to the character being focused on for that scene, in terms of old relationships with people now deceased. A fancy of way of having them see their life flash before their eyes, but it's not literally part of their story or the show itself. It's just artistic expression by the show producers, and is an instance of pushing on the fourth wall, but nothing in these scenes is actually happening...

- These scenes are meant to be taken literally; in other words, the dead really are appearing to the living as supernatural beings, but only when the living are alone by themselves.

Now I don't believe they are merely ""artistic license"", or an occasion of the writers wanting to break the fourth wall or do a tribute to a character that's on their way out. My theory is the spirits of the dead really are dropping in to say 'hi' to the living one last time, or are standing by to escort them to the next world. They are physically manifesting through some supernatural power and appearing in the material world either to comfort, encourage, or perhaps rebuke the the living for whatever reason.

[S8] The Walking Dead Season 8 Premiere Gets Extended Runtime,,1,
Why don't they run?,"It's my first time visiting this subreddit and I have finally been binge watching TWD and came to the last season, season 7. 

I haven't watched beyond episode 8 of season 7 so would prefer no spoilers. 

However every time something bad happens with Negan I get this nagging voice in the back of my head saying: ""Why don't you just run?""

I can perhaps understand the first time. They feel strong. Capable. So they take out the outpost. Of course you're not gonna run. But then they find out how big Negan actually is and two of their companions get brutally killed.

At that point I am already like... hell no don't stay. But maybe they want revenge, I get it. But then they still learn more new things of how big and dangerous they really are and they *still* aren't running and instead just giving in with risking all the lives there. People literally die and they still don't run. 

The world is big, right? With holding back some guns in the pretty big town they could've easily been like 'fuck it' and left somewhere else where it's actually, you know, safe, and they don't have to give all their supplies to Negan.

Apologies if this was already discussed in this subreddit - I know some things might be rehashed daily in TV subreddits, so I might be circlejerking over something already solved.

I was just wondering if there was any other reason to it besides just for the show's story. ",1,"Why don't they run? It's my first time visiting this subreddit and I have finally been binge watching TWD and came to the last season, season 7.

About one of my favorite characters.,"I feel like Maggie doesn't get near as much love as she deserves. She's not as flashy as Rick, Daryl, or Michonne but she's just as awesome! I don't think anyone has suffered as much as Maggie. The three people she loved most in the world were brutally murdered by other people, 2 of them right in front of her another right after she was told they were even alive, not to mention being terrorized by the Governor. She's brave, resilient, and one of the most consistently forward-thinking and grounded characters of the show. I especially loved her in the episode ""Them"" where she is teetering on the edge of giving up hope but then turns it around and has these beautiful small scenes with Daryl and Sasha. She's had some awesome episodes/scenes away from Glenn as well, with Carol in The Same Boat, with Gregory in Knots Untie, and Sasha/Bob in Alone. I'm really looking forward to seeing her in a real leadership position next season and kicking some ass. ",1,"About one of my favorite characters.

Daryl Is an Angel,"Someone else has probably seen this by now but oh well. I think that Daryl Dixon is a fallen angel, and here's why. 

Daryl has always had the same vest with angel wings on it. Not only that but even during season one when he was a lot less lovable, Daryl has been saving people. He's always been looking to save people. His brother was the first person he needed to save. He went back into Atlanta to save him. Aside from the fact that Daryl has always been attempting to save those he feels he can and who deserve it. This becomes his job in season 6. Leaving Alexandria to go and save those who he can. 
Back in season 2 Daryl searched the most for the missing girl (who I forgot the name of). He outcasts himself because he is ashamed that he fell away from the other Angels. 
Also he wouldn't let Beth drink, won't seek a relationship, and he always survives EVERYTHING. 

There is definitely more evidence but this was just a quick thought jot down, and If this has already been someone else's theory or been confirmed then lemme know with a source and I'll take it down",1,"Daryl Is an Angel Someone else has probably seen this by now but oh well.

Why Did They Leave?,"The Prison.

Why not return to The Prison in the morning when they can properly assess things?

It still had walls, the holes could be repaired. The Guvna was finally dead along with all his remaining people.

Yeah, it's filled with walkers, but so was it when they first arrived. They could clear it again. The cell blocks were empty as we see when Glen enters for gear. All of their supplies are still there. 

All they needed to do was regroup, return and they could take it again.

No matter where they went afterwards, they'd face the same problems. So why not return to where all of their supplies already existed and just repair the damage?",1,"Why Did They Leave? The Prison.

[Comic Spoilers] What would you add to the future of the TV show?,"What things do you want the show to incorporate into its future seasons? For me:  

1) Use the comics as a guide, but shift things around in a smart, fresh way.  

2) Reference old seasons and past characters more. It seems like the seasons can be disjointed when old characters and events are forgotten.  

3) Be willing to kill off characters like Daryl, Carl, etc.  I think giving their deaths meaning is important, but no one should be safe.  

4) Have the group deal with a natural disaster.  We see other groups and zombies, but a hurricane or earthquake event would be a nice change.  

5) Do not have them ever discover a cure. That should be left alone, but I feel the characters deserve to know what caused the end of the world.

I'll get the ball rolling...

* **Base** - I like the Alexandria concept of what is essentially a neighborhood of environmentally sustainable homes surrounded by thick steel walls.  I would clear the surrounding area of trees to increase visibility and erect a few more guard towers.

* **Defenses** - Stop seeing Walkers as a menace and start viewing them as resources.  Tether Walkers to large stakes in the ground along the walls.  They will run interference against invaders attempting to scale the walls.  Also, build a gatehouse to defend the main entrance.

* **Crowd Control** - Instead of running away from Walkers, kill them whenever reasonably safe to do so to keep their numbers down.  Rule is that all neutralized Walkers must have two stabs to the head at different angles to confirm the kill. Walker bodies should be collected and used as building materials to form barricades or mazes to slow the advance of other Walkers.

* **Safe house trap** - Set up a safe house for citizens who are kidnapped by rival groups.  If enemies tell hostages to lead them back to the encampment, they will lead the enemies to the safe house instead.  Safe house will have regular surveillance and if trouble is detected, a rescue can be mounted without compromising the location of the primary encampment.",1,"[Spoilers] Post-apocalyptic kingdoms I'm looking for people to share their ideas on how they would create a post-apocalyptic kingdom in the Walking Dead universe.

Most notably, he seems to always, at least 5 times he's on camera, will lean back, bend his knees, and tilt his head back and laugh. It was cool to see it at first, but now that he does this all the time, it gets old.

[COMIC] The Drop Of Quality,"Hey there.
So, I just finished issues 171 and god damn, is it not the true definition of low quality? I mostly just ramble in this post, so if you don't want to read it all, here's the short version: the comic dropped its quality and slowly goes downhill about in the middle of The Whisperer War.

There were days when I waited for every Wednesday, because I knew there is going to be something interesting in TWD. Now after finishing an issue (which ends VERY quickly, by the way; it took me 5 minutes to beat 171), I feel nothing. Absolutely nothing good, only complaints or nothing. 

Firstly, I don't mind not having as much Rick. His story is pretty much done and the only thing there is to resolve is his relationship with Negan. It is pretty obvious that Kirkman is going to kill Rick off closer to issue 200. But the thing is that we don't really have a protagonist. We spend some time with Carl, Dwight, Negan, Maggie, but it never focuses on someone. You can't have a story that has no central character. It just feels empty and all over the place. In the show, for example. even if you don't see Rick or Negan all the time, you know they are there, you feel their presence.
And speaking of characters, there doesn't seem to be any progression at all. The only recent character development I can remember was Yumiko and Magna, only a tiny bit, and even that little bit was actually forced by the fans. If you read mail, about 5 issues ago one fan asked about Magna not having any character at all. Then boom, we get this pretty lazy development, which lasted only for a few pages.

From the story we kind of jump from one point to another one without finishing everything off. We just had a huge horde of walkers, then they kind of deal with it and never remember again. Then we jump to The Saviors, Dwight's wife dies, Negan handles the situation and we never talk about them again, then we go to meet that new community, then some Princess... and we'll probably never talk about them again. No consequences at all.

My another complaint is how the story is spoiled, predictable and not really original. 
It is very obvious that RIck will die closer to issue 200, that Beta will appear in a few issues and that probably he is somehow connected to that Princess. It becomes very predictable and they don't even care about spoilers. Spoiler-covers are released way ahead and you can't not see them, because everyone posts it online.

The dialogue is almost non-existent. It goes from short lines that sound like they were said by only one character to something randomly obnoxious thrown in (that talk about minorities in 171). 

Plot armor also is a major problem. Andrea gets killed off for the sake of killing her off, while we don't get any deaths in the Whisperer War, except father Gabriel. It's a war. You can't have a war with such skilled fighters who can manually operate huge amounts of walkers, who can sneak upon literally anyone and have those awfully sharp knives. It's just laughable. How can there be a war with no casualties?

My last complaint is how the comic feels like some sort of fanfiction or a very-very raw script with pictures (sometimes not the best ones) for the show. Everyone wants to hate the show now, but we don't even think about how much effort it is to turn this mess of writing that Kirkman makes into something worthy. 

Kirkman needs to spend less time on some lawsuits, unnecessary cash-grab stories (Here's Negan). He needs to do something interesting, because right now I see no reason why I would want to continue reading this. ",1,"[COMIC] The Drop Of Quality Hey there.
So, I just finished issues 171 and god damn, is it not the true definition of low quality? I mostly just ramble in this post, so if you don't want to read it all, here's the short version: the comic dropped its quality and slowly goes downhill about in the middle of The Whisperer War.

There were days when I waited for every Wednesday, because I knew there is going to be something interesting in TWD. Now after finishing an issue (which ends VERY quickly, by the way; it took me 5 minutes to beat 171), I feel nothing. Absolutely nothing good, only complaints or nothing. 

Firstly, I don't mind not having as much Rick. His story is pretty much done and the only thing there is to resolve is his relationship with Negan. It is pretty obvious that Kirkman is going to kill Rick off closer to issue 200. But the thing is that we don't really have a protagonist. We spend some time with Carl, Dwight, Negan, Maggie, but it never focuses on someone. You can't have a story that has no central character. It just feels empty and all over the place. In the show, for example. even if you don't see Rick or Negan all the time, you know they are there, you feel their presence.
And speaking of characters, there doesn't seem to be any progression at all. The only recent character development I can remember was Yumiko and Magna, only a tiny bit, and even that little bit was actually forced by the fans. If you read mail, about 5 issues ago one fan asked about Magna not having any character at all. Then boom, we get this pretty lazy development, which lasted only for a few pages.

The obvious answer is a no-brainer, of course. They've obviously become smarter, faster, more aggressive, and know how to handle themselves around walkers.

What do you think made Shane turn psychotic? He and Rick had been best friends forever. I'm guessing he was always a hot head but to become completely insane, why? Obviously you could blame the goddamn zombie apocalypse but it didn't happen to anyone else. 

I feel like he would've been epic in S3 and onwards if they worked it out. Turns out his way of doing things was the right way all along. 

Merle was a breath of fresh air and a great character, he also could've been much more.

Hershel shouldn't have died.

What are some of Ricks most questionable decisions as a leader?,"I think Rick is mostly a good leader, but sometimes I don't get him. I know he has a lot of responsibility being the trusted decision maker, and so it's inevitable for him to fuck up sometimes, plus without that he would be boring. I've only seen season 6 (which is where I started), and 1-3 so far, and I'm coming up to the end of season 3 when he did something plain weird in the 13th episode.

He meets with the Governor and he put his weapon down, asking Rick to negotiate with him. Considering everything Rick knows about this guy, and the fact that he poses a big threat to their current shelter, you'd think he'd shoot the fucker right there when he had the chance. He's killed innocent people up to this point to protect himself and his people, yet he hesitates with a serious enemy like that. He shot his best friend when he threatened his life so I don't buy that he's really that gullible. 

In season 6 when he decided to help Jesus and his community against the saviours, I knew it was a bad idea, but I didn't know how bad. It makes sense even if it was risky, but I think that was one of the most dangerous position he's placed on himself and his group that I've seen so far.

Although I think he's made mistakes, I feel bad for Rick. He has such a heavy burden to carry and he suffers because of
It. 
What do you guys think?

What's the most messed-up scene from the show so far?,,1,
Analysis of Carol's breakdown,"There is a scene where Carol tally's up how many people she killed. You can see The initials of Karen, David, Ryan( Lizzies' dad), Lizzie, Candle lady (Mary), and multiple others. She tells Maggie in "" The Same Boat"" that she has killed 18 people in total, adding even more after Paula, Mols, and 'Chelle. I think she senses something is wrong with her, like an underlying enjoyment of killing or maybe just a morality lapse. The breakdown goes back way further starting in season one. Not much is seen from her but it is known that her husband Ed beats her and her daughter. She was not physically nor mentally strong enough to stop him. When Ed is attacked by Shane, she rushes to his side and is literally begging for forgiveness. After the walker attack on the Atlanta camp, she finally get revenge against Ed while simultaneously giving him mercy ,by not leaving him to turn, by repeatedly slamming a pick into his head. Fast forward to after Sophia has turned, Carol is distant. She talks about her daughter like she was a husk of the girl she couldn't protect, and inevitably failed to do so. After the winter on the road, she picks up a few survival skills and continues to evolve. The next sign of ""Savage Carol"" is when she tells Andrea to kill the governor in his sleep. She is obviously cold at this point, after she was left in solitary for days after the walker invasion ,her best friend in the apocalypse has dies in childbirth, and a friend was shot to death in front of her while she had to use his body as a shield. Fast forward again to when she kill Karen. She thought she was doing the right this regardless of what others thought. After that she is exiled from the only family she had left, and was left to her own devices. At some point she meets up with a fragment of her group and through it all the two girls who she has basically adopted at this point are murdered, Mika by Lizzie, and Lizzie by Carol. Its so metaphorical that Carol put Lizzie down because ita just what happened with Sophia but she is doing it directly. She couldn't keep anybody safe no matter how hard she tried. So when she heard about terminus, she was going to save them, all of them. And she did that by killing alot of people. You can tell in season five that its already getting to her, she is distant and even tries packing up a car and leaving but Daryl followed her and they went to find Beth. While on this trip, she saves Noah and is hit by a car. Beth saves her life and days later she is shot right in front of her. At this point i think she's beginning to think that the people she loves are dying because she brings bad luck. This cycle of her killing for the greater good doesn't bother her until she meets Morgan. She begins questioning her motives and thus begins the breakdown. When she tells Maggie she shouldn't be at the saviors compound and that she should be someone different, she is saying that Maggie should take this opportunity to be a good mother and not waste is like herself or Lori, just to be in on the action. So after killing Paula and the rest, she is traumatized by her own decisions of how to handle things. I think Carol truely is afraid to die, as was suggested by Paula, but more than that I think she is worried of what will happen after she dies. Whether its an afterlife issue, represented by the sharpened rosary she squeezed until she bleed, or she's worried about how the group will fair without her. I think she thinks the group needs to help itself more then relying on a few to do the dirty work, so that's why she leaves. She doesn't want to kill for people who wouldn't kill for her, and I think she thought the best course of action would be to leave. After all, no one she loves makes it very far. So its better to have loved and to lost then to love and kill a shit load of people or get everyone she loves killed (even though ita not all her fault.)

Lesson learned: It can be a bad idea to binge watch TWD too much.,"I recently watched season 6 for the first time, loved it, so decided to watch seasons 1-5 before the premiere of 07. I have seen a fair amount of season 1-3 on tv in previous years but wasn't as into it.

It's some dark shit. I got so sucked in that I didn't realize I was increasingly becoming depressed and melancholy. 
I think it's a fantastic show, but for me is not meant to be watched in one sitting.
I mean, our poor miserable group live in this grim reality with no end in sight. It seems to be hopeless for them and I can see it heading that way- never ending suffering until the end of the human race.

I've never felt an existential crisis before. But that's exactly what binge watching this show has made me think about. What's the purpose, meaning and value if in the end we all die, and every accomplishment we've ever achieved will be forgotten.

So yeah fair to say I'm addicted.

I'm taking a good break from this shit hah.
Have a good day. 

",1,"Lesson learned: It can be a bad idea to binge watch TWD too much. I recently watched season 6 for the first time, loved it, so decided to watch seasons 1-5 before the premiere of 07. I have seen a fair amount of season 1-3 on tv in previous years but wasn't as into it.

It's some dark shit. I got so sucked in that I didn't realize I was increasingly becoming depressed and melancholy. 
I think it's a fantastic show, but for me is not meant to be watched in one sitting.
I mean, our poor miserable group live in this grim reality with no end in sight. It seems to be hopeless for them and I can see it heading that way- never ending suffering until the end of the human race.

I've never felt an existential crisis before. But that's exactly what binge watching this show has made me think about. What's the purpose, meaning and value if in the end we all die, and every accomplishment we've ever achieved will be forgotten.

So yeah fair to say I'm addicted.

I'm taking a good break from this shit hah.
Have a good day.

Gonna get some things off my chest about Carol and Darryl. Not about hooking up though. Sorry.,"Darryl is a loose cannon. He is ALWAYS taking off half cocked. Just jumping up and running out of the gates with no plan or communication. It drives me nuts. Its such a cheap plot device, oh Darryl's manning up again, let him go out and get people killed. He got the doctor killed on the railroad tracks that day, I completely blame him. And it didn't make any sense, his character is smarter than that godammit. And everyone just thinks he's this great rogue hero. (I do completely appreciate how hot he is, though I wish he'd take more showers.) And what the hell is up with Carol leaving? What does she think is gonna happen. If she shows up in a zombie guts poncho to save the day again I'm gonna be so disappointed. She was so great through S6, playing it all so smart, but somewhere along the way she lost her reason. Instead of this tribe of survivors getting smarter every day, they're losing their shit. I just want to see some intelligent strategy. Some discussions about survival. Make me believe these people are smart enough to survive this and make me want to root for them. Last thing, I think Maggie's getting offed. They can't seriously have two babies to cart around in a zombie apocalypse. Ok, now I'm done.",1,"Gonna get some things off my chest about Carol and Darryl. Not about hooking up though. Sorry. Darryl is a loose cannon. He is ALWAYS taking off half cocked.

[Future show spoilers] Idea about season 7 opening,"Rumor has it that there will be a dream sequence of all the main cast eating dinner in Alexandria during episode 1. I think it would be awesome if they opened the episode with the dream sequence, all of the main survivors sitting around the table, happy. Eventually Rick notices that one person (for this description I'm going to say Glenn because I really hope he is the one that gets Lucilled) not talking and staring straight forward. Cutting back and forth, Rick would try to get his attention, and then a shot of Glenn with blood dripping down his face, back to Rick being alarmed and calling out for Glenn, back to Glenn with his head starting to cave in and his eye popping out with a disembodied echo-y voice of Negan saying ""Damn...taking it like a champ"". From there they could cut to Rick coming to on the ground, after passing out, watching Negan finish off Glenn.

It probably won't actually happen this way, but I think this would be a jarring way for them to open the season with a false sense of calm before the killing.

EDIT: Apparently /u/ScreaM92 had the same idea, but set from Glenn's perspective. His set up is awesome and you should read it if you haven't already

What are your memories from watching the series' premiere on Halloween 2010?,"I was a college sophomore at the time. I lived in a crappy dorm and was surrounded by friends who had selected to have rooms on the same wing/hall that year. That night the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead aired on AMC prior to the premiere. Everyone gathered in my and my roommate's room to watch. There were 10 of us total.

I remember enjoying the slow pace of the episode. I imagined that it wasn't a big budget affair, deciding to rely on the human impact of the story. It definitely delivered, and I definitely teared up watching Morgan not being able to put down his zombified wife.

Comic &amp; Show Spoilers: Would this moment have worked for show?,"Related to the season 6 finale.

This is something I've occasionally wondered about. In the comic, when Negan is done reducing his victim's head to mashed potatoes, Rick tells him that he's going to kill him. Negan asks him to speak up, and Rick says that it may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but he *will* kill him.

Now, as awesome as this is, I feel like having him still be full of piss and vinegar would undermine the idea that Rick's confrontation with Negan is about breaking him. In the comics, while Rick may have underestimated the Saviors, I never got the impression that he had become particularly arrogant. The show decided to play up how cocky he'd become, only to have Negan shatter his world view along with his friend's head. Because of that, I feel like it might be better for the show to leave out this moment of defiance, and let Rick build himself back up gradually.

Because of that, I feel like it might be better for the show to leave out this moment of defiance, and let Rick build himself back up gradually.

What say the rest of you?"

[Spoiler] That awkward moment in season 6,"I'm re-watching the series in preparation for season 7 and I have to say I warmed up to the idea of Richonne since the first time around. My opinion the first time was that it just felt a little out of the blue, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one. It wasn't an awkward moment in itself, I just felt awkward watching it because I felt like I missed something.

I don't think anyone is denying that they have developed a close relationship over the seasons. It's that the relationship suddenly became romantic that took some of us by surprise. There was nothing romantic about their relationship before, they were just two people who worked great together and cared about each other in an apparently platonic way. I would argue that that's a perfect foundation for a romantic relationship, but usually as romantic feelings start to develop we would expect to see some sort of indication of that. Whether it's doubt, insecurity, realization, acceptance, or anything really, there's usually some precursor. 

Obviously we don't know what the characters are feeling or thinking, but in a TV show we expect the writers to express these things one way or another to the viewers. The second time around I sort of thought ""Yeah, I guess that makes sense"" but I don't know if that's just because I knew what to expect. Any thoughts? I'd love to hear other people's insights.",1,"[Spoiler] That awkward moment in season 6 I'm re-watching the series in preparation for season 7 and I have to say I warmed up to the idea of Richonne since the first time around.

[SPOILERS] Need opinions regarding a bet I made concerning THAT moment in season 6,"So at the beginning of season 6 I made a bet with a friend that either Daryl or Glenn would die before the season was over.  Unfortunately, this has been complicated by the infamous handling of the finale. 

She ordered me to pay up as the credits rolled on the final episode. But I made the argument that, come the season 7 premier, if we find out that it *was* either Glenn or Daryl who took the bat, then they technically died in season 6 and so she should be the one to pay me.

She seemed to accept this argument but, as the premier date approaches, I have begun to worry that the truth as to a time of death might not be clear cut. 

For the sake of argument, let's assume that Daryl or Glenn definitely got a healthy dose of Lucille to the head. What if they get beaten to a pulp (which definitely happened in season 6) but still draw a final breathe during the premier of 7? Because we only get one perspective during last season's finale, can we be sure that whoever Negan chose definitely died during the POV sequence? Perhaps they only fell unconscious and then died moments later during when, I presume, season 7 will pick up. If this was definitely the case I would have no trouble paying up to my friend even if it's true that Daryl or Glenn was chosen. I want to be as fair as possible.

Please help me with this conundrum there's a whopping 5 dollars on the line.

Lori Grimes: Mrs. Contradiction. (SPOILERS),"Has there ever been a reason given by the show runners or writers or anyone else as to why Lori's character contradicts herself so much? I'm watching seasons 1 &amp; 2 again so here's a couple examples;

- Tells Shane that she, Carl and her family are off limits to him and tells him to not go near Carl again. In the season 2 premier when Carl finds the blades Shane tells him to give them to Dale and Lori bitches at him for being so blunt and then giving her the cold shoulder. 

I'm sure there are others, but in a show with numerous flaws and a logic abandon I atleast kinda want the characters themselves to make sense. So yeah, is there any reason given to us for this?

"[Spoilers] Season 3: episode 6, Hounded. How things could have gone.","Glenn and Maggie are out on a run and stumble across Merle.

As a result of how this situation goes, a lot of horrible things happen.

On the one hand, I do understand that the very last time Glenn saw Merle, shit was not good. Shit was really, really not good. Also, with his new gangster (having been on the road all winter, conquering the prison, losing three people (he thinks)) he was less inclined to take chances, particularly with someone who was already a troublemaker. It would have probably been very different if the Morales family had shown up in that little town.  

On the other hand. Merle lowered his gun. He obviously would genuinely want to find his brother, and it's not unreasonable that he'd be willing to let bygones be bygones to be reunited with Daryl.  

On the other other hand, Michonne wouldn't have joined up with our group, at least not right away. And who knows how long she would have made it with that bullet wound?

"Mild [Spoilers] I've been catching up on season 6 via Netflix, gotta say this has been the best season in a while IMO","I still have 4 episodes left to go before I finish season 6, but I've really been enjoying this season especially compared to the last few. I liked season 4 and 5 just fine, but season 6 has been of a higher quality IMO and I'm glad to see the show is getting stronger instead of weaker.

My favorite episode was the episode that they introduced Jesus. I loved the Rick/Daryl bro time and the chase between Rick, Daryl, and Jesus. It was nice to see non-threatening, lighthearted conflict for once. I wish we could have more ""a day in the life of the ZA"" episodes, without all the crazy explosions, and walls collapsing, and other crazy things going down. I also really liked the ending to what I'm assuming was the MSF, where they all went out and went crazy taking out the entire herd in Alexandria. That was awesome.

[SPOILERS] Interesting response from Kirkman about S7 premiere.,"So I was scrolling thru Kirkmans latest AmA and I've found an interesting response. When some fan was complaining about the cliffhanger this is what he said: 

&gt;I personally liked it (cliffhanger). Scott Gimple and I spent many months going over exactly how to stage it and how to adapt that scene. Many options were discussed. I do strongly believe that when you watch the season 7 premiere (if you do) you will see the **two halves of the story and it will all make sense why we did what we did.**

What does he mean by two halves of the story ? Gimple said that we will have to wait for like 2-3 minutes before we find out who is the victim, could it be that they will show us Daryl's POV ? Because we already saw one part of the story (Ricks journey to Negan), the only part we didn't saw was Michonne's, Glenn's, Rosita's and Daryl's way to Negan. Combine this with Kirkmans statement on The Talking Dead when he said ""there are definitely hints there (hints about who died)""  I think its safe to assume that the victim is 90% someone whos story we didn't see. In this case its Glenn, Daryl, Michonne, Rosita. 

He might also be referring on Gimple's quote when he said ""first part of the story is Rick losing control (what we saw in S6 finale), and second part of the story is who died (S7 premiere).

I have a theory about the rest of the series concerning the walkers...,"So, at the beginning of the series, this whole plague was just getting under way when we see Rick awake in the hospital. And those who have just become walkers are still pretty human-looking. But as the series has progressed, I've noticed that the ones who've been around it seems for a while are starting to look worse and worse, almost pure skeletons. 

So I believe that within a short enough time (at least for the show's timeline), the walkers will start thinning out more and more and will eventually cease to exist...for the first generation. But what about people who have never been bitten who just die from either old age or some other disease? Does that mean that an entire new generation of walkers will come around? I don't know. Just something I've thought about for a while.",1,"I have a theory about the rest of the series concerning the walkers...

"[SPOILERS] Just rewatched ""What Happened and What's Going On"" (S5E09), and it is still such a beautiful episode","Nicotero and Gimple really outdid themselves with writing Tyreese's death. It was one of the most poignant and symbolic process of death in the entire show since Lori and the phone.

The comic has some graphic and violent ways to die that are horrifying in how they play out. However, this I think, is one of the handful of moments that AMC is able to push past Kirkman in storytelling. The characters of Tyreese's past coming back to judge him on what he's done and lead him to either guilt or release is beautifully done.

Just as beautiful is the phase where the group carries him to the car, and we see flashbacks to the moments of his time we knew him. And finally, in the beginning, the grave we thought was for Beth becomes Tyreese's, and in its symbolic nature, the episode goes full circle, just like life and death.

[Spoilers] Walkers and how they eat.,"I'm not one of those guys who nitpick on every unrealistic stuff in TWD and i think the show would be not so satisfying if the points below were realistic but i just wanted to discuss it. 

First off all, how does everyone instantly turn into a giant blood cake when they're about to be eaten by walkers? (Noah is the best example) I can't dive my normal human hands into someone and take their intestines out so how can they do it with mushy rotten hands? I'm pretty sure their nails would've fallen off so that's out of the picture. Same thing goes for their mouths. It's definitely possible to get a good chomp but still probably not as easy as how they do it in TWD. Maybe you can argue that rotten teeth are much more ""efficient"" but it wouldn't make sense since they are easy to kill with blades BECAUSE of their rot. 

Second of all, how does the walkers know when to stop eating someone? There are some cases in the show and comics where they can't come back because they got eaten too much (R.I.P Father Gabriel and Lori) but there are some where they can still turn. In the comics after No Way Out, we get to see walker Jessie with a good portion of her cheeks completely chomped.. But why did the walkers eating her stop there?
In the show when Paula (i think that's her name? Red headed saviour girl??) got impaled and got her face eaten, the walker could've eaten her whole face enough to damage her brain and prevent her from turning, but it didn't. 

Lastly, If someone were to turn very recently, would other walkers eat him/her? Walkers differentiate themselves from people through smell but if someone recently turned and he'd still be carrying all those fresh organs and blood like a walking zombie pi√±ata, wouldn't they still eat them?

Does this bug anyone else? It's not a deal breaker, love the show and it's unrealistic to expect too much realism lol."

I love Season 6's ending.,"Jeffery Dean Morgan as Negan, suspenseful ending, and I was surprised as fuck.

I stopped watching the third to last episode, because I couldn't see a impressive way to end the season. However, when I saw it arrive on Netflix I gave it a shot. I re watched the entire Season 6, to arrive at that ending.

Seeing Rick scared was awesome, because I have never seen him like that for a couple seasons.

Jeffery Dean Morgan was awesome. I haven't had the pleasure of reading the comics, but I love his persona. 

I have seen posts complaining about the cliff hanger. However, I loved how it was played out. There is a great difference between great cliff hangers and bad ones. That was honestly the one of the best cliffhangers portrayed in a television series.

Not important: Just rewatched seasons 1 and 2. So much more clarity to Lori and Rick...,"First things first, I see everyone hates Lori. I started watching TWD when I was 13 so maybe all of their ""grown-up"" issues didn't phase me as much but 6 years later, that woman is an absolute trainwreck of a human being. 

I honestly believe Lori was just as in much in love with Shane as he was with her. That whole grieving widow bit didn't last long with me. My goodness, I never realized how troubled Rick and Lori's marriage was before the ZA but add to the world ending, the dead eating the alive and your wife screwing with your BFF and then getting pregnant by one (SHANE) of you, there was no way she and Rick would've lasted long. All Lori needed was a solid reason to believe she could escape or at least step out of her marriage and believing your husband is dead is solid enough. She must've been thrilled to go on her little rendezvous with Shane or anyone who threw a bone her way. When Rick came back, it was kinda like she pushed Shane off of her, told him to hush, fixed her skirt and joined Rick as he went on to lead the free world. Then she did the ultimate number and planted this idea in Rick's head that Shane needs to be killed and got mad at Rick when he actually did so. I think it was then that he finally understood that Lori really did care for Shane more than she led on. He just practically killed the man that she was going to eventually further cheat on him with. At this point, I totally understand why Rick was so cold towards her in Season 3. All the sacrifices he made for her alone added onto the fact that the baby was most likely not his, Lori destroyed this man.
It was season 2 that we first found out about Judith. Crazy to believe that still.

Is the show catching up to the comic?,"Hi, show-only viewer here. I am curious to ask some of the comic readers if the TV show is catching up to the current issues of the comic, or if they are running at about an even keel? By that I mean, there are (I assume) 12 issues of the comic each year, so is the show following the comic at about a pace of 12 issues per season, or is it moving faster?

I ask because I wonder what they will do if they catch up to the comic. I used to watch a lot of anime and I remember that the shows always started to go south when they caught up to the manga and the show writers had to start coming up with stories of their own.

I'd appreciate if this question could be answered in broad terms without spoiling the comic, even though I have heard some spoilers.

S7 Premiere Discussion : Impact of Negans Victim,"I'm super excited for the premiere of the walking deads new season, but Im really nervous at the same time.

Glenn's my favorite character, and every arrow is pointing on his direction. I'm on edge thinking about what's gonna happen if he dies?

There's also a survey people took and 34.7 percent of people believe Glenn will die. Abraham takes the silver with 30 percent.

Both of these characters are fan favorites (especially my beloved Glenn) and I feel they will not only take a toll on the fanbase, but the characters in the show as well.

"[COMIC SPOILERS] Comic Michonne, and reasons why she's awesome.","I have a lot to say about comic Michonne, and I've been met with a lot of disagreement from show fans particularly. She is very different in the comics versus the show. I've seen a lot of people totally trashing comic Michonne and I wanted to offer a counter-argument because she is my favorite character in either media, overall. I'd love to open a discussion about comic Michonne (either on her own or in comparison to TV, whatever you want to post.)



When Michonne first showed up in the comics, don't get me wrong, I was a little irritated. I was a pretty big Careese fan, and she randomly walked in and screwed that up, pretty unapologetically. But I quickly came to understand her character. She wasn't trying to hurt anyone, and once she realized she had, she was pretty devastated. Plus, after the fight between Rick and Tyreese, she was shilling for the two to become friends again, because she saw how upset Tyreese was. Essentially, my theory for this entire portion of the series was she struggles with predicting how her actions will effect others in the long run, and she has a hard time resisting impulses. It makes her very human.

On top of that, the entire thing with the Governor was amazing. I know a lot of people complained about it being over the top, but to see a woman experiencing rape and then getting revenge without mercy was an extremely powerful experience for someone who was not able to avenge that in their own life, but has always had the desire and struggled with those urges. It seems like it could be helpful as a 'living vicariously through her' thing. And by 'seems like', I mean in my experience it is very powerful and healing.

And on that note, Tyreese and Michonne are very important in the long run. Tyreese is so supportive of her and allows her to be comforted when she needs, gives her space when she needs, and eventually they wind up having sex again. Seeing that represented in a way that doesn't make the woman 'weak' or 'needing her man' was refreshing beyond belief.

And as for more recent issues, she has become a really amusing character. She is very much known for her tendency to hook up with guys, and say awkward things, but nothing stands in the way of her being an absolute badass. As a girl who's been made to feel worthless because I have had social issues and poor relationship skills, I saw Michonne, I felt slightly uncomfortable, then I settled in and accepted that I am her, and I can be a badass too.

She's an important character. She's a unique character. I LOVE TV Michonne, don't get me wrong, but comic Michonne is not some inferior prototype.

[SPOILERS] Some thoughts on Season 6 finale...,"I liked the cliffhanger.

Alright, before you dismiss me out of hand hear me out! Not only did I not mind the cliffhanger, I actually liked it. Here's why:


1. Let's imagine for a minute that there wasn't a cliffhanger and they had shown who was killed. Where would we be as fans right now? The finale would've ended on a horrifying note, leaving us stunned and sad. Forums and this subreddit would go crazy for maybe a month talking about Negan's introduction and how we can't believe that X died. And then we'd fizzle out. At this point in the season break, if I knew the Lucille victim, I would've moved on, completely forgotten about the show, and most importantly, I wouldn't be invested at all in season 7's plot lines. This way, season 7 starts off with a MAJOR bang, and then they'll set up the main plot points for this season right away.


2. If there wasn't a cliffhanger, all of us by now would've come to terms with the fact that X is dead. It would be really boring for us to see everyone mourning and adjusting to life without X, swearing vengeance against Negan, etc... This way, with the death being in the premiere, we get to mourn with the characters - everything will feel more genuine and gut-wrenching.


3. The arc honestly does make a lot more sense to have the death at the beginning. Just think about it, since the death is at the beginning of the season, it'll be a huge source of momentum for the show and every character. Obviously it would be the same for the characters either way (cliffhanger or no cliffhanger) but not for us. By the time we will have processed the death as much as we would have if it were in the finale, we'll be eight episodes in.


To anticipate a few counter-arguments:


""It was just a ratings grab.""


Yes and no. I'm sure that was part of why they did it that way. However, I agree with Gimple (or was it Kirkman?) when he said that they didn't want to tell the story that way. I totally see where he's coming from - basically what I said above.


""They fucked it up and I can't take it seriously.""


Talk to me after the premiere and you've seen one of your favorite characters get their head bashed in. I guarantee your gusto for the show will return. Whether or not you want it to return, however, is another matter.


""They ruined an iconic scene from the comics.""


Tough shit, it works better this way. 

And they didn't ruin it. If you don't think that having the season open with the cold-blooded and gruesome murder of one of our favorite characters won't be iconic, then you've got another thing coming.

I really did think about this, and I can't think of any way that the comic scene plays out better on screen. The only thing I can think of that would work just as well is if they saved the entire Negan speech plus the beating for the premiere, but then you'd have an ocean of fans who are pissed that they didn't get to see Negan in season 6 even though they've been building him up for like 2 seasons. That actually would've pissed me off, too.


As the premiere gets closer and closer, I'm getting more and more excited, and I get bummed seeing people on this subreddit who are disenchanted with the show because of the cliffhanger. Hopefully this gets you pumped for Season 7, because I am SO ready.",1,"[SPOILERS] Some thoughts on Season 6 finale... I liked the cliffhanger.

[SPOILERS] Norman Reedus deleted a picture that might indicate the fate of one character in S7.,"Ok so Norman Reeedus posted this picture on his Instagram with a caption ""6.16"" but he deleted it afterwards. 

http://data.whicdn.com/images/254430072/large.jpg

Now a lot of u are asking ""what is wrong with the picture ?"". Andrew Lincoln has blood on the right side (our left) of his face, and if u remember back in 6.16 we didn't see any blood on Ricks face. Norman captioned it with 6.16 so it was during the shooting of that episode. My guess is that they filmed the entire scene in 6.16 and they just decided to cut it. JDM basically confirmed this when he said that he didn't even know that the episode will end on a cliffhanger, so he had to know who he killed. 

Now back to the investigation. In the line up u can see that the only people on Ricks right side are Maggie, Abe and Michonne. Now we know that Negan didn't bring the victim in front, he bashed him/her right on the spot, so its the possible that the victim is the person who was on Ricks right side (because of blood positioning) therefore the blood on Andrew's face is the blood of the victim. Judging by the ""amount"" of blood on Andrew's face the victim can't be Maggie because there would be a lot more blood because she was closest to Rick. On the other hand Michonne is pretty far away so the blood would hardly scratch Rick. That leaves us Abe who fits the position (he is between Maggie and Michonne). 

Here is the picture of the lineup for a better view of the distance: 

http://i.imgur.com/XAcyrSC.jpg

This seems a pretty strong evidence that Abe got the bat unless Andrew spilled blood on his face for the lulz. So if this picture is not important why would Norman delete it ? It doesn't contain nudity or something, I think he figured out that the fans might connect the dots so he decided to delete it just in case.

How many Saviors do you think there are?,"I, admittedly, haven't read the comics, so maybe the answer's there.

(Jesus, I think?) said Hilltop had ""seen groups as big as 20."" But there was at least 50 in the woods during the s6 finale, not to mention the (approximately) 20 killed at the ""satellite"" site and roughly another 10 killed by Daryl with the rocket launcher.

And something interesting: Negan says to Rick and Co. ""We (The Saviors) invested a lot so you would know who I am and what we can do."" Does this line imply the 50-or-so Saviors there were a big ""investment"" of Negan's force? I mean, it'd be interesting if Negan commanded a legion of hundreds but Rick and Co. have to put up a realistic fight in the upcoming ""all out war"" and I'm not sure Alexandria and the Hilltop combined make even 50 people from what we've seen along with various context clues--and among those 50 there are, what? 10 real fighters? The Saviors are, presumably, an entire group of badass-Ricks!

I dunno, what's your thoughts?

Tl;dr? How many people does Negan command? Can Rick and Co. put up a reasonable fight?

[Comic Spoilers] [Spoilers] [Possible Future Spoilers] Daryl to take a certain character's place in a later story arch?,"Does anyone think it could be possible that Daryl could take Michonnes later story arch, and leave for a few years, becoming a pirate? 

Michonnes show character is way happier right now than her comic character was at this point, and it looks like she's gonna take Andrea's comic character's place. 

Daryl just keeps getting broken, and it's getting a little repetitive. Obviously, he isn't suited for the kind of life the Alexandrians are living, and what the group is hoping to set up. I don't see AMC killing him anytime soon, so I think this is something that they could have him do. Plus, Daryl fanboys and fangirls would be so stoked when he comes back later. 

I don't know, it could also be Sasha who does this, but I'm pretty sure it isn't gonna be Michonne, unless something happens in season 6 to make her need to leave.

Biggest pet peeve about the walking dead.,"So around now we are probably 3 years into the ZA. Pretty much everyone alive currently are survivors. They can live in the ZA and survive. So it really pisses me off when characters are introduced just to be killed off. They can somehow survive 3 years, but 20 minutes of screen time is too much to handle. The poncho guy comes to mind as an example. 

There are more people dying then are being born. We can't just keep bringing in random people and killing them off. 

I would just love for the show to end with some random no named person coming in and just wiping everyone out. Because that's apparently plausible in this show.",1,"Biggest pet peeve about the walking dead. So around now we are probably 3 years into the ZA. Pretty much everyone alive currently are survivors.

[SPOILERS] Season 6 Some questions overanalyzing the Cheesemaker,"I often overanalyze things and I was just really wondering about Eastman (the Cheesemaker) and his claim that there is only one evil man he has ever met. I have some questions...

Why did Eastman think that, out of the 825+ people he interviewed in his career, Creighton Dallas Wilton is the only evil man he has met?

Did he decide that Wilton was the one evil man after what happened with his family and therefore is biased (as anyone who's family is hurt by someone will believe that person to be the most evil person)?

OR

Did he decide that he was pure evil prior to what happened?

Had he seen something in Wilton that he had never seen before? A level of psychopathic tendencies that he had never believed possible before meeting Wilton and therefore had the belief that Wilton was the one evil man he met?

I don't know...

[Comics] The Walking Dead: The Cutting Room Floor (Reddit Edition),"I don't think the actual [book](http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/The_Walking_Dead:_Cutting_Room_Floor) is ever coming out, but there is still plenty of cut material from the comics that have been revealed over time. Here are 12 things that I have read or heard about being cut, all in one nice post. Spoilers up to issue 100.


1. Kirkman considered killing off Rick at the end of volume 1, instead of Shane, thinking it'd be a cool twist to kill off your apparent main character. Carl would witness this, and Shane would manipulate Carl, telling him Rick had gone crazy or was bit, leading Carl to doubt what he saw, and be forced to live with the man who killed his father.


2. The prison was supposed to be found in volume 2 instead of the farm, and in fact was supposed to be a school.


3. Lori was supposed to be stabbed in the stomach by Thomas, killing the baby. That poor baby never had a chance.


4. Speaking of Lori, at the end of volume 3, fed up with Rick's decisions and constant leaving, was going to take off her wedding ring, tossing it at Rick and telling him she wants a divorce. We would then have to see the two living together now divorced (and dating others maybe?)

 However, as he was writing it, he felt it no longer worked, and that wasn't genuine to have her turn her back on Rick. This is why volume 3 ends with a cliffhanger, which may be the norm now, but at the time wasn't. It's actually cool to go back and see the set up for this.


5. Apparently, Hershel was going to get bit in volume 4. However, he felt bad enough for Hershel after killing off five of his kids, so he spared him and gave the death to Allen.


6. Lori was supposed to disappear sometime after the group got back from Woodbury, and would be missing until The Governor showed back up, revealing Lori on a leash, riding right next to him with the baby in hand. She would be his ""slave wife"" and this obviously would had broken Rick's heart. This idea was brought back for the bonus ending in issue 75. 

 He has no outcome to this, but you can only assume it would end up with the baby dying. Because apparently he hates that little fucker. 


7. There was some more terrible stuff the Governor does, none of which Kirkman reveals. I assume most of it would've been related to Lori, probably some more sick stuff to Michonne.


8. Lori and Judith were supposed to die in issue 47, but was pushed back to an issue later. I'm glad, because their deaths helped make issue 48 one of the most legendary issues of The Walking Dead.


9. Glenn was supposed to die in issue 75. Well, he technically did, in the bonus ending. But, he survived in the actual story, and would live until issue 100... more on that later.

 Bonus fact, issue 77's cover was supposed to show Maggie after his death, where it seems she would've had a stalker? Spencer maybe? Could just be Pete walking by, but that's why it seems a little out of place with the rest of the story.


10. Sometime after issue 75, Rick, Carl, and Michonne, unable to trust and relax in the community, would leave, and go off on their own for a little. He lead this up in issue 75 with Michonne knocking Rick out.

 The story would then follow these 3 until something happens, in which they return to Alexandria. We would then see some changes that had happen since they left. Eventually leading to the same All Out War arc. However, he thought it was more important to build up a relationship with Rick and Andrea, so it was scrapped.


11. Abraham was supposed to survive issue 98. He and Eugene would have a firefight with Dwight and the Saviors, and make it back safely to Alexandria. However, he thought that was lame so he killed him instead.

 Had he lived, there would've been a love triangle story line between him, Holly, and Rosita.

12. The story originally took place in the 60's, featuring a buffer Rick and his wife, ""Carol"". Oh, and it also took place in Pennsylvania. 

13. Father Gabriel was originally supposed to be named James.


14. Rick was going to be put in a situation where he'd be forced to kill Glenn to save Carl. But, he couldn't think of a situation that wouldn't be unrealistic, so instead he created Negan to kill him off, while still making Rick powerless.",1,"[Comics] The Walking Dead: The Cutting Room Floor (Reddit Edition) I don't think the actual [book](http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/The_Walking_Dead:_Cutting_Room_Floor) is ever coming out, but there is still plenty of cut material from the comics that have been revealed over time.

Help on rewatching the show!,"I'm currently in the middle of my rewatch of the Walking Dead, in anticipation for the new season. I'm just about to start season 4 and my boyfriends just decided that he'd like to start watching with me.

Rick's overconfident attitude in Season 6,"Rick is one of my favorite characters and I love how much his character has evolved throughout the series. But when it came down to Season 6, I really didn't like how overconfident Rick had become. Is there anyone else here who felt the same way?

And it wasn't really just Rick, most people in Rick's group like Daryl, Maggie, Rosita etc. were all overconfident when it came down to dealing with Negan and the Saviors threat. Because they have had overcome and have survived plenty of dangerous encounters in the past, like The Governor and Woodbury, The Claimers, Terminus etc. that handling this new threat would be nothing but a walk in the park. It kind of also made them very arrogant.

Shower thought on Lupin's teaching,"Note : sorry for non-fluent english. 

Most of us love Lupin. First as a competent and empathic teacher, then as Harry's friend. After Quirrell and Lockhart, Lupin appears to be the first competent teacher in DADA. He knows how to manage a class without authority, despite being less than charismatic. In his first class he immediatly gains respect by bamboozling Peeves without effort, a not-so-easy task to do. Despite being a bit of a bookworm (see book 5), his teaching style includes a lot of practice and experiment. 

&amp;#x200B;

But what really strikes me is that Lupin uses two personal traumas to design his teaching style :

1) He chose to teach about evil creatures.  

Being a survivor of the first war, Lupin has a large set of skills in DADA. But no, he chose evil creatures despite being one of the most feared hybrid, a werewolf. He is litterally in the classbook! 

For me this shows how brave Lupin can be. He knows how it feels being a beast no able to control its urge, but he taught everyday about to neutralize them, their weakness. This also shows how much he hates being a werewolf and hurting people, that's why he wanted to learn students to protect themselves. 

2) His first class is about fighting fear

The first creature of the semester is a Boggart. To fight a Boggart you have to laugh, so not being afraid anymore. Even is the Riddikulus spell is useful, you have to laugh and set you free from the fear. Molly Weasley showed us in Book 5 that the spell itself is not enough. 

Despite being a Gryffindor, Lupin knows very well how fear can be dangerous. He describes himself as a coward (first by being afraid to stand up against James and Sirius when they were bullies back in Hogwarts, then by not informing Dumbledore of the Animigi nature of Sirius). While Lupin cleary has a poor opinion of himself, he knows how fear can paralyse people and make them do bad or stupid things. 

So he made sure to learn to his students how to fight fear. This lesson was not only about Boggart, but about fear in general. It is no coincidence that Lupin chose Neville to fight the Boggart first, being the most easy to scare.  

I really admire Lupin for his ability to use his traumas to help people around him. Maybe he sees this is a form a redemption path for being a werewolf, but its requires a lot of bravery to use our own mistakes to help others instead of hiding it.

You don't have to write an anecdote, I just felt like it."

Baby Fawkes,"I find it interesting in CoS, when Fawkes dies and is reborn Dumbledore walks down to the ash pile. Birds latch on to the first being they see. Since Fawkes wouldd see Dumbledore first he would ofc be attached to him. However I think with Harry being in the room as well it sort of binds the Phoenix to him as well. Or maybe he's smart enough to realize that Harry is someone his ""mother"" trusts.",0,"Baby Fawkes I find it interesting in CoS, when Fawkes dies and is reborn Dumbledore walks down to the ash pile.

Favorite House duo?,"My favorite has to be SlytherPuff!

Why? Well, I feel like they balance each other out. With Slytherin being more confident and less caring, if a Hufflepuff had a Slytherin bff they could help them learn how to be more nice, whereas the Slytherin could teach them how to be more assertive and teach them to defend themselves properly.

Does Voldemort remember Harry from first 2 films?,"So rewatching them and just finished goblet of fire and when Voldemort is brought back he acts like it‚Äôs the first time meeting Harry despite the first two films. 
Or did he just not bother to mention their meetings from before? 

I thought maybe when Tom Riddle met Harry in the second one it was like a different consciousness or something? 

I only read the last two books so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs better explained in the book. 

Cheers for any insight.",0,"Does Voldemort remember Harry from first 2 films? So rewatching them and just finished goblet of fire and when Voldemort is brought back he acts like it‚Äôs the first time meeting Harry despite the first two films.

Question about Chapter One,"As everybody knows, the first chapter is set the day after Lily and James' deaths and the fall of Voldemort. IIRC, this was almost immediately followed by the mass-murder of muggles by Pettigrew. Yet in the first chapter, when we see the muggle news, there is no mention of this, instead, they're talking about how owls have been spotted over the country. Wouldn't a story about owls be slightly overshadowed by a terrorist attack? Would like to hear your thoughts as I only really thought about this yesterday.",0,"Question about Chapter One As everybody knows, the first chapter is set the day after Lily and James' deaths and the fall of Voldemort.

Out in the wild Harry Potter references?,"Not sure if this has been asked, I've lurked a lot and recently started commenting‚Ä¶and I have not seen this question recently. I'm just curious.

Have you had experiences where someone made a comment referencing Harry Potter without you having brought the topic up?¬†

I've had a few and they've made my day.

The first time an unsolicited comment came up was from my ex-boyfriend. I was leaving our date, and he said that he wished he ***""was a wizard and could cast the spell to make me stay with him.""*** Part of me loved that he would make a *Harry Potter* reference, but the other part did not appreciate the implied use of the Imperius Curse (he didn't know spell names, since I was still in the process of teaching him).¬†

Near my university, someone had renamed their wifi to ***""Portkey to Hogwarts""***

Two have happened at work (different sites)

1. During my first year in grad school, I was assigned to a local mental health clinic. During my first official day, shadowing people, I was allowed to go into grief training. The presenter answered ***""everyone has a he-who-must-not-be named in their life,""*** in reference to population's grief and mental health complications after losing a loved one.
2. During the onboarding at my new job last week, I was introduced to a group that was made to foster a positive life outlook. Everyone was being supportive in the virtual group, and the facilitator was in the process of commenting about this when another member said it was because there were ***""Hufflepuff's in the house.""***¬†

Hogwarts Legacy and J.K. Rowling's drama,"Hello fellow Potterheads

I think everyone have watched the reveal trailer of [Hogwarts Legacy](https://youtu.be/1O6Qstncpnc) already after that breathtaking leaked video and I'm sure many people like potterheads, gamers or RPG geeks are excited for this game now as not only it's the dream come true that we can finally go to Hogwarts but this game possibly be one of the best RPGs if it's done right as the potential to bring out from Wizard World's world setting.


However, the argument has been raised up as well as many of you know about J.K. Rowling's tranphobic view that create uncertainty on this game.

As a gay man, I can't refuse I feel betrayed as this series help me come out too (can't explain why). Seeing my hero of my childhood treats other people badly makes me sad. 

However, it doesn't change how much I love this series and how much I'm excited for this game. Although I won't support J.K. Rowling like before, I still support this series with all my heart. Although I hate his mom, I still love her son.

Did Harry's glasses actually help him see?,"Genuinely curious, asking for thoughts (and references if there are things I just missed when I last read the books).

From my experience with glasses and literally everyone I've ever known who has needed to use glasses, when your eyesight starts to worsen from a young age, your prescription just continues to change for a while before stabilizing. As far as I remember, Harry has always had the same glasses throughout the entire series and wore them ALL the time, even when he was playing quidditch (if I'm remembering right?). So assuming he has had his glasses since a pretty young age, even before he starts at Hogwarts, and assuming that his eyesight progresses in the same way it does for a lot of people in real life, do you think he can actually see well with perfect or at least close to 20/20 vision? Do the glasses actually function in a way that is supposed to help him see? ...Or are they just there?",0,"Did Harry's glasses actually help him see?

Hermione and the Locket,"I'm really curious about how the Locket affected. We know it made both Harry and Ron extremely short-tempered and angry. Harry's doubts about his friends' loyalty and his own capabilities magnified exponentially while Ron's jealousy just about exploded out of him. 

So what did it do to Hermione?

As far as I've read, a lot of people get the Horcrux to tell her to quit. And I see why. Not only is it sensible, it's easy to do. There would be whisperings of how dangerous this quest is. How being with Harry now places her in more danger than any other person in the world. How she obviously has the skills to go about it alone, especially if those dunderheads aren't weighing her down anymore. 

The problem with this strategy is that it really doesn't get Hermione at all. People have been telling her to quit FOR YEARS. We have Malfoy, and the rest Slytherins mocking her up and down that she doesn't belong in the Wizarding world, that she's lesser for her blood. All she's done is work much harder to spite them.

This also doesn't take her own sense of courage and loyalty to account. Hermione is the one person who never left (see:GOF). HARRY tried to get her to leave. She's been placed in mortal peril so many times before, all in the name of getting Harry to where he should be. Back then, she actually had a place and a family to go and hide when things got too hard. And she doesn't have those anymore.

Lastly, that tactic doesn't consider Hermione's fear of failure at all. Based on her boggart in third year, failure is one of if not her biggest fear, and now the stakes are much higher.

She was almost single-handedly dealing with the logistics of their camping trip from hell. She was in charge of food, defense (she did all the warding before the boys learned), and research. We see in the Post-Ministry heist what happens when she fails. Ron was hurt because she FAILED to apparate them properly. There was a lot riding on her ability to do magic and get answers, and it becomes clear early on that if Hermione's magic fails, they're going to die. Quitting is not an option here.

So based on this, I figure that instead of the Horcrux telling her to quit, it told her to work harder. 

And it seems counter-intuitive at first, but think about it. How much harder can Hermione work before she crashes and burns? The food is limited, there's danger everywhere they go, the boys are at each other's throats, and she still has a shitton of research to do. That's a lot of responsibility on a 17-year-old girl. That's trauma and toxic stress all rolled into one neat camping trip. 

Now imagine that the Horcrux is whispering to her that she's not doing enough. Her love interest almost died in her arms because SHE splinched him. SHE failed, and her friend almost died. Have her imagination run wild and play all the ways her parents could be dying right now because her charms failed. Let it play the names of all the people who died because she's not producing the answers they need fast enough.

And the Horcrux croons to her all the ways she's failing and failing and failing. How can she just lie there and do nothing as others are out there and dying?! Forget that she can't remember the last time she's slept. Ignore the fact that she can barely see straight from the exhaustion, that her hands shake as she weaves the wards. She's so tired she's about to puke, but she can't stop yet. She hasn't earned her rest yet.

She's NOT doing enough!

The Horcrux can't make her leave, but it can work her to the ground until she has nothing more to give.

The Only Good Thing to Come out of Cursed Child,"I know most of you hate Cursed Child with a burning passion, but can we please appreciate the one good thing it gave us? You know what I'm talking about...or maybe you don't, I don't know. Any guesses? 

Scorpius Malfoy. I'm talking about Scorpius Malfoy. 

No one ever talks about Scorpius, but I think he is a really great character. He made the Cursed Child actually bearable to read. 

For those who don't know, Scorpius is a huge, loveable nerd. He is a total social outcast, he hates sports, and he is terrible with human interaction. I don't want to speak for everyone, but he is almost a reflection of the reader. 

The funniest part is that he is the son of the rich, bully Draco Malfoy. Ironic much? 

Moving past his sweet, loveable personality, Scorpius has some baggage too. And I'm not talking about the whole ""Everyone thinks Voldemort is my father"" thing either, because honestly - that's kind of stupid. 

No, I'm talking about how hard it must be for the boy to be judged for the bad actions of the previous Malfoy generations. Most people just see Scorpius as - well - a Malfoy; A typical, racist jerk. But this isn't Scorpius at all. 

It's a good thing he made friends with Albus Potter, who Scorpius is totally gay for. Don't believe me? Then read this quote: 

""If I had to choose a companion to be at the return of eternal darkness with, I'd choose you."" - Scorpius Malfoy

Yeah. They're clearly in love. 

Anyway, let me end this post with some of my favorite Scorpius Malfoy quotes. 

""I had [an imaginary friend]. Called Flurry. We fell out over the correct rules of Gobstones.""

""All we have is our wits and ‚Äî¬†no, that's all, our wits.""

""I am--Scorpius the Dreadless. I am--Malfoy the Unanxious...What's the worst they can do? Bring back Moldy Voldy and have him torture me? Nope.""

""Do either of you know what Polyjuice tastes of? Because I've heard it tastes of fish and if it does I will just vomit it back up. Fish doesn't agree with me. Never has. Never will.""

""Wow.¬†Squeak.¬†My geekness is a-quivering.""¬†",0,"The Only Good Thing to Come out of Cursed Child I know most of you hate Cursed Child with a burning passion, but can we please appreciate the one good thing it gave us?

A letter to J.K Rowling,"I love Harry Potter. I always have. Hermione was my role models when I was younger, helping me get through years of bullying. I dreamed to get a Hogwarts letter and be taken away where I was accepted and special. My eleventh birthday passed with no letter. I was sorted into the Gifted program which only made me feel more alone and different. Along with some other books, Harry Potter helped me through, and I was always grateful. Even as my life went on and I gained friends, I still cherished the book even when my friends said, ""That's such a kiddy book.""

But then we have you. Oh, yes, you, J.K. Rowling. I love your books, and when I was younger, I worshipped you like a god. But I know better now. Your views are disgusting. You are disgusting. I can't believe you wrote a book with an Asexual character (Charlie, who prefers dragons to women) and a gay character (Dumbledore, who felt romantically attracted to Grindelwald). You are a gross, trans-  
phobic brat.

Let's make some things clear:

If someone identifies as a woman, she is a woman.  
If someone identifies as a man, he is a man.  
If someone identifies as something else, they are what they identify as.

I love Harry Potter. I still do. But I've never loved you. When I was young and dumb, I have. But now I know better. I know that you are disgusting. I know what a transphobe is, and what a homophobe is. I am a demigirl pansexual, and I know that you are gross and disgusting. I have said those words a lot, but there's no other word that fits.

I love Harry Potter.

Respect for Mr Weasley.,"Just rereading the books. I've realised how much respect Mr Weasley had for Harry when he and Mrs Weasley had the argument in the leaky cauldron. Mr Weasley was probably the first adult in the books that wanted to keep Harry informed of what he may be facing in the year ahead. 

I've read the books multiple times. But it never hit me with Mr Weasleys warning, he was trying to protect Harry without treating him as a child.",0,"Respect for Mr Weasley. Just rereading the books.

How come Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is the most hated? (movie),"I've been rewatching the HP films lately, and Half Blood Prince seemingly might be me favorite now, the reason why that's is kind of shocking is that this was never one of my favorites. And it is quite amazing to me how this is somehow looked at as the worst Harry Potter film for a lot of people. I quickly want to mention that I've just started reading the books (40 pages in on Philisopher's Stone to be exact) so if anyone thinks I have said something wrong, explaining to me would be nice. This is just a discussion, not a grilling.

It seems  to me that most of the criticism has in my opinion, been quite weak. It's especially quite annoying when it seems that people don't have the same critical look at Deathly Hallow's part 2. The Half Blood Prince is by no means a perfect film, I do recognize that it has it's problems. But when people complain that the film wastes time on the romantic subplot, I'd have to disagree. Within those scenes, we get characters growth, visual story telling. We also see Hermione and Harry discussing the narrative at the same time. 

I understand that people wanted the film to focus on Voldemort's backstory more, but I think it is much more crucial to focus on the main 3. Ron was already a very inconsistent character before Half Blood Prince, which seems to have started in Prisoner of Azkaban, and the focus he got in Goblet of Fire was very poorly presented if you ask me. In Order of the Phoenix he didn't really have much of a focus at all. But if he didn't get the character development in this one, I don't think Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2 would have been able to work. 

Another complaint I've heard is the whole burrow getting destroyed scene. Which I agree with, that whole scene is stupid and pointless, but how is that a big argument as to why the film doesn't work? It's like 5 minutes of the film, and I understand that Harry and Ginny were complete idiots in that scene, but if you look at the scene that transitions it, it seemed like David Yates didn't care about the scene at all. It was just a dumb thing written into the script.

I've also seen people say Ginny's character is bad in this film, which I also agree with. Their relationship suddenly starts out of no where, Ginny does hint in Order of the Phoenix that she likes him, but that's about it. This relationship is especially strange considering how Harry invites a muggle woman on a date in the beginning of the movie. I also think Bonnie Wright didn't particularly deliver her lines very well in this aspect, neither was the dialogue very good.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I don't want to invalidate anyone's opinion, but to me it just kind of seems people have very thick nostalgia glasses, that they can't handle the fact the movie does some things differently. I find this particular clear when people complain Harry was psychically able to do something against Dumbledore's death. The reason why I think it's stupid to complain about this is because Harry trust's Dumbledore's word, it adds a certain emotional depth, that I don't think would have been there if Harry couldn't move psychically.

The reason why all of these things doesn't me as much as others, is because I simply love what David Yates did directing this. Even though I love Order of the Phoenix, I would be lying if I didn't think that movie is too fast paced, it felt too crammed, like it had too much to do. In Half Blood Prince there was a real atmosphere, having scenes with characters just chit-chtting is perfect, as it adds a lot of character, it also all felt purposeful.

The film making is also much better here than in Order of the Phoenix - the movie looks amazing. Bruno Delbonnel (the DP) was able to create this balance of darkness and warmth on the color palette and lighting, which is something that's also reflected in the tone of the film. The tone is very comedic, but behind that, it's very dark. The lighting also changes throughout, in most of Draco's scenes, it's much more white and cold. There's even the cave scene, where it's fully black and white. I also think the comedic tone works very well as it adds a lot of humanity to the characters.

I‚Äôm thinking about not reading the Epilogue to my seven year old.,"My seven year old loves Harry Potter. She‚Äôs read the first six like a bazillion times. We‚Äôre currently reading the seventh together and about halfway through. I‚Äôll just get it out of the way:
I don‚Äôt like the epilogue. And I‚Äôm wondering if choosing to just leave it off would take away from the experience. 

My thinking: To me, it doesn‚Äôt do anything to add to the story. There are no loose ends it ties up. It‚Äôs literally just a snapshot to see who ended up with who and how many kids everyone had. I get that it shows everyone is content, but wouldn‚Äôt a seven-year-old assume that after a good vs evil kids‚Äô series ends? What am I forgetting about that makes it mean anything, besides a glance between Harry and Draco, and maybe knowing what happened to Teddy? It‚Äôs also just written poorly (not a reason to leave it out on its own, I admit) and I don‚Äôt like the way it glorifies Snape.

Once we‚Äôve finished the book, she‚Äôll want to watch the movie, and I wouldn‚Äôt stop it before the epilogue. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll let her just think it‚Äôs a movie addition for now until she reads it on her own.

Incredible Hogwarts Common Room concept art by Qing,"I'm bummed that we never got to see the Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff dorms in the movies, so I decided to do some concept art googling, and that's when I came across these and was absolutely blown away by how much thought and detail went into each. 

These really touch on how grand I always felt the common rooms are when reading the books. They're far more expansive than anything we see in the films, which I always felt were a let down given how many students there are in each house.

These really touch on how grand I always felt the common rooms are when reading the books. They're far more expansive than anything we see in the films, which I always felt were a let down given how many students there are in each house.

The DADA curse,"I have looked for this and I haven't been able to find it mentioned anywhere, so here it goes.

Did the curse disappear with Voldemort's death? We know it wasn't dependant on his power, since if it was it would have vanished when he got UNO Reverse Carded by Harry; we know of magical effects that outlast their casters, such as pretty much everything in Hogwarts (the Chamber of Secrets, for example, must have been enchanted by Slytherin (the Parselmouth lock, to be precise), and the next person to visit, Tom, did so roughly 955 years after the fact, and it still worked apparently fine).

So, would it have disappeared after the fact? Or would McGonagall just be forced to apply wacky rules-lawyering to get around the curse, such as opening an adjacent, legally distinct DADA-only school (tentatively called Swogwarts) right next to Hogwarts, or simply renaming the class to ""Methods both Offensive and Defensive for Dealing with Arts and Crafts of Different Kinds Including but not Limited to Dark, Light, and Acrylic""?",0,"The DADA curse I have looked for this and I haven't been able to find it mentioned anywhere, so here it goes.

Not Canon but would be awesome if included: Harry and the Dumbledore Army.,"The DA disintegrated after OOTP or atleast we didn't get much of it in HBP.

So, Harry continues teaching students even after they got a proper DADA teacher. But since Harry didn't trust Snape very much or whatever, Harry decides to teach the students in his free time. With Ron and Hermione subsituting him sometimes.

They will have clashes with Slytherins students, but it will some become the main mischief around school after Fred and George left.

Harry will teach them all sorts of spells after those in OOTP, and share some of his stories. A good leader for all the students when the Voldemort is out in the open. And since there are rumors about Harry being Chosen One, these classes will have so much impact. Not to mention, Dumbledore and McGonagall secretly assissting Harry with the classes.

Now, that Ron has gotten a place into Quidditch, and he also substitute Harry in DA, his confidence will grow many folds, and shaping him into a strong character, and making Hermoine to fall for him even more.

Then, the tragedy happens, Dumbledore died and he was seen with Harry the last time. Confusion stir up in DA, some trust Harry some don't. This is where the DA actually disintegrates. This leads the character of Harry in gray area. His is now neither a leader or a villain. Just someone students don't trust. 

Harry didn't return Hogwarts in the seventh year. Some students thinking Harry was actually involved in Dumbledore's assassin. Neville and Ginny standing up against them and defending Harry. Not to mention, giving headaches to Carrows. Both of them becoming secret leaders to the DA, which have handful of members left. They try to steal the sword, bringing glory to the DA. Off page, this will develop Neville and Ginny character. Especially Neville, which pays off with the final blow at Nagini.

Half of the year passes, things are getting darker, Voldemort is on rise. Students want to rebel but can't. Everyone in Hogwarts is stuck in misery even the teachers. Then one day, Harry returns and everyone's spirit are risen again. Snape and Carrows are thrown from the castle, we have hope!!!

This will be Harry's leadership payoff moment, when he stands on the front line and leading the DA and other students to the battlefield and everyone shouts his name and only his name. Harry emerging as a true leader in the battle.

Alternate (dark) ending to HP novels.,"As I age, I‚Äôve found myself pondering more dark endings for the HP series. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the whole ‚Äúlove conquers all/self sacrifice‚Äù aspect and the how J.K.R tied in the three brothers with how Harry conquered death! But one dark ending that I continue coming back to is this-

Instead of approaching Voldemort and welcoming death as a friend, Harry and Hermione are caught by dementors and essentially have their souls sucked out. For Harry‚Äôs case, the part of Voldemort‚Äôs soul is removed,but for Hermione she actually losses her soul (obviously this happens when Ron leaves them). The hurt and sadness Harry and Ron feel is beyond measure and it ultimately starts to drive Ron mad because he blames himself for leaving. Harry is shocked that he didn‚Äôt become a shell of himself, and then starts to put two and two together without the help of Dumbledore. He feels even more alone without his friends. The war ends but he is truly never the same. 

Ya I know this is super dark.

I just found out how the Portraits in Hogwarts work.,"From the wizardingworld:

**H**ogwarts portraits are able to talk and move around from picture to picture. They behave like their subjects. When a magical portrait is taken, the witch or wizard artist will naturally use enchantments to ensure that the painting will be able to move in the usual way. The portrait will be able to use some of the subject‚Äôs favorite phrases and imitate their general demeanor.

However, these portraits are literally and metaphorically two-dimensional. They are only representations of the living subjects as seen by the artist. 

Traditionally, a headmaster or headmistress is painted before their death. Once the portrait is completed, the headmaster or headmistress in question keeps it under lock and key, regularly visiting it in its cupboard (if so desired) to teach it to act and behave exactly like themselves, and imparting all kinds of useful memories and pieces of knowledge that may then be shared through the centuries with their successors in office.

The depth of knowledge and insight contained in some of the headmasters‚Äô and headmistresses‚Äô portraits is unknown to any but the incumbents of the office and the few students who have realized, over the centuries, that the portraits‚Äô apparent sleepiness when visitors arrive in the office is not necessarily genuine.",0,"I just found out how the Portraits in Hogwarts work.

So I Was Wondering Who Everyone Would Choose to Back Them in a Fight,"So... I had a random thought today... Who would people pick to be their ally in a fight? There are a *lot* of skilled witches and wizards in the HP universe, so I had a lot of people to run through in my head. Eventually I decided to just go with our favorite group of Hogwarts students. 

So here's the dealio with this poll:

1. Sorry if your favorite character is not here. I can only put six options at a time (Maybe someday Reddit will let us include more).
2. I know there are a lot of other characters who are better at magic, dueling, etc. but I just decided students from Harry's year (plus Ginny) would be the easiest to go through.
3. I will make another poll with other characters, and the Weasleys will get their own poll altogether, so keep an eye out for them.
4. Feel free to leave a comment about why you chose who you chose! I'll be checking in and replying to people as comments are left. 
5. Have fun with this! Even if the person you want to pick isn't necessarily the ""best"" at magic, doesn't mean you can't still pick them. Maybe you want someone who you know will be there and have your back even when you're cornered. Just enjoy this and don't think too logically!

So, I think that's everything! On with the show! 

I'll be real and share that I voted for Luna because... She's Luna. Great healer, creative personality, and probably one of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. Who *wouldn't* want her on their side?

Please educate me on the hp books!,"Hello! I have a big problem. 

Me being the idiot I am, thought it would be a good idea to write a 20-chapter long story for my friend's birthday. She's a hardcore Harry Potter fan. She has read all the books and watched all the movies multiple times. I have 6 months left to write 17 chapters. 

The story is about the Malfoy family and the protagonist is Draco. It begins in Philosopher's Stone and follows the original storyline. Of course, I'm aware that Harry is the main character, that means I'm forced to come up with a few ""fillers"" in the story. 

I'm trying my best to change and twist the way he is portrayed in the movies. 

I am a big fan, too! I still remember that day my dad showed me the first movie 10 years ago. Problem is, I haven't read the books. (Yes I know, shame on me lmao) What child would want to read such thick books? Not me. 

Could somebody tell me some canon stuff about Draco and guide me through the storyline? I've gathered a fair amount of research myself, but the best way to learn more is to ask the experts in this fandom!

I do not have any time on my hands and I'm not exactly able to read while writing. 

I promise, right after my friend's birthday party, I'm running to the nearest book store and purchasing all hp books."

Reasons why Slughorn is underrated,"Slughorn is the first person Harry meets who tells Harry more about his Mom, while everyone else talked about his Dad, or only mentioned his mom in the context of ""Oh, she died to save you"" or ""She loved James."" Slughorn is the one who starts telling us who Lilly was AS AN INDIVIDUAL rather than just in relation to the other characters.


""bUt hE pIcKs fAvOrItEs"" so does Snape (but over half the fandom loves him despite that), Dumbledore, and arguably McGonagall if you count her bending the rules to get Harry a broom in book one. Also, Slughorn treats his not-favorites with kindness, too, even if he can't remember their names. He's snobbish, but not cruel.


... While we're at it, Slug Club is no different than many real-life school organizations. Honor Roll is about who has the highest GPA which doesn't always determine work ethic or intelligence, many schools have events for students nominated by a teacher for whatever reason the teacher nominates them, etc. although in fairness, it is possible Slug Club was meant to be a commentary on such ""student reward programs""


Slughorn was smart enough to get reinforcements to help in the battle, even if it meant the others thinking he was running away like a coward. I saw someone try to claim ""he only came back once he saw who was winning"" which is BS because he would have had no way to know who was winning all the way from Hogsmeade, and that would have given him little time to gather reinforcements.


Dumbledore and many others remark that Slughorn is a very powerful and skilled wizard. He also duelled Voldemort alongside Minerva and Shacklebolt during the Battle of Hogwarts and held his own against one of the most powerful wizards to ever exist. Also, Felix Felicius and Amorentia are some of the most difficult to brew portions in existence, so the very fact he had some (including a bottle he was giving away as a prize) is a testament to his abilities. Slughorn is no weakling.


He's the first Slytherin we meet who isn't either a racist, bully, or villain. Took Rowling long enough!


In the books, he was well respected by Hogwarts staff, and was NOT STEALING THOSE DANG LEAVES FOR MONEY! He was trading with Sprout to insure his classroom had plenty of supplies.

I watched all the HP movies for the first time this weekend,"And I gotta say that ""The deathly hallows part 1"" is one of my favourites, I never read the books, so maybe the movie sucks, but I loved it. I love the ""3 friend on an adventure kind of thing"" I love that it's a bit slow paced because I love the characters and its really good that we can see them interacting with each other like ""normal people"" just one more time before that huge battle, the scene with Harry and Hermione dancing it's gorgeous and I really can't understand how people can hate it just because that would never happen in the books, it shows just how much of a good friend Harry is and seeing that even with that little moment Hermione still isn't happy  we can see how much she loves Ron and wishes he was the one dancing with her. Also the Dobby scene is heartbreaking I loved that fucking elf.
 Maybe I don't have any taste and I get that the books are better and have more detail but a movie won't ever be better than the book it was based on so can we please stop the whole ""didn't like it, the book was better thing""?

Harry exudes arrogance pretty permanently through the books and to use Snapes words, Hermione is an ""insufferable no-it-all"".

Ron seems to be the glue of normality that binds the three of them together.

Maybe he's ignored soemwhat because deep down everyone wants to be a Harry or a Hermione, but in reality most of us are Rons."

Did Snape truly hate Harry?,"Just finished reading Deathly Hallows for the first time since high school a few years ago, and though of course we knew Snape seriously disliked Harry, do you guys think he truly hated him? Despised him, &amp; loathed him of course, but honest to god hate, the same way Umbridge or Voldemort had?

Why or why not do you think this? 

Just a thought I had, though I don‚Äôt believe him loving Lily changes anything at all, I suppose Snape could have done worse things to Harry, but I wonder if Dumbledore hadn‚Äôt been around at all would Snape have cared what happened to Harry at all? Would he have cared if Voldemort murdered Harry? Or did he grow to accept him?",0,"Did Snape truly hate Harry?

My thoughts on Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy.,"English isn't my first language.

Contains spoilers. A lot of them. If you haven't read all of the books, don't read this post. The rules say I don't need to mark it as a spoiler so I didn't because it's just about the books and movies but I'm new here so...

I'm fairly new to the subreddit and this is the first time I am posting here. I don't know if it's already done (it probably is) but why do people think Snape was a good man?

Some of the reasons why I don't think Snape was good.

‚Ä¢ He bullied Neville so much that a boy, whose parents are in a Mental Asylum because they were tortured to insanity by a mad woman, feared him so much that he became his biggest fear.

‚Ä¢ He encouraged bullying by enabling Malfoy when he enlarged Hermione's teeth and then made fun of her. 

‚Ä¢ He was the one who told Voldemort about the Prophecy.

‚Ä¢ He said he couldn't care less if James died but Lily should be left alone.

‚Ä¢ I'm aware of the abuse he had to go through because of James and Sirius (I hate teen James and Sirius. They became better people after they grew up.) But that still doesn't give him a free pass to bully Harry. He is a literal kid.

‚Ä¢ He called Lily a mudblood, one of the worst slurs if not the worst slur in the wizarding world.

He helped wizarding world a lot, I'm not going to deny that. He spied on the dark side for the order that probably saved lives. The author (her name is a taboo, I don't want Snatchers at my place) herself said that Snape was a morally gray character. Neither good nor bad.

He was given a redemption arc that I felt he didn't deserve. Even if he did, there are a few characters that deserved the redemption arc more than him.

Draco, for example, was a child. I'm not going to brush off the things he has done because they are inexcusable. But we have to remember that he grew up like that. His parents taught him that he was wizarding royalty, that no one was better than him and that he, a pureblood, was the most deserving of the magic that he had than anyone else. 

In the Astronomy tower, he was even going to lower his hand. He didn't want to do what he was ordered to do. He was scared for his and his family's life. He had done some terrible, horrifying things in his life. But he was taught that he was the best and that everyone would want to be his friend. 

He also pretended to not recognize the trio when they were brought to the Malfoy Manor by the Snatchers. He should have gotten a better redemption arc than I guess I just won't kill you today.

He was, without a doubt, a better father to his son than Harry was to Albus. That is why I believe that other characters, like Draco Malfoy, deserved a redemption arc more than Severus Snape.

Explain to me how Slytherins are not just glorified assholes.,"this is not directed at individual slytherins but at the concept as a whole 

I mean, not to be too rude, but ""slytherin characteristics"" are pretty much ""so, here's what makes you a narcissist, self-centered, inconsiderate d!ck.""

All the positive slytherin traits are found in other houses: self preservation, intelligence (ravenclaw), leadership (gryffindor), ambition (ravenclaw and gryffindor). 

the rest of the traits are basically: leave other people in the dirt if they are not of use to you; only be nice to your friends, family and people who are of use to you; treat people like stepping stones to your goals instead of idk, human beings; and overall behave like a corrupt politician .

newsflash, leaving other people behind to seek your own selfish interest is NOT a personality, it's a bad trait. these are all bad traits. the traits in me that would be classified as slytherin traits are all things i consider bad or toxic, definitley not traits i would build my personaity around, but rather thing i wish to eliminate or change about the way i behave. like when i notice myself being so selfish that i dont help someone over a minor inconvenience, i dont consider that a good thing. or when i notice that i change my tone when my interests concerning someone change i dont consider that as a positive either, rather a slimy trait. or when i am willing to do everything for a goal to the point where it becomes dangerous or toxic, that's not a good thing either. being vengeful is anything but good thing. 

if i lived my life with slytherin traits i would be simply just an asshole. idk why anyone who is not an edgelord would want to build their personality off of this. 

using people, being opportunistic, switching sides and ditching people when convenient, only being nice to people of interest, being manipulative, selfish, etc are NOT good traits. the slytherin approach to life is toxic af. 

gryffindors can be reckless and feisty and ravenclaws can be arrogant smartasses but they don't behave like they stole their personality from frank underwood ffs. 

i understand that there are people like this, people who can sympathise with these values or recognise that they behave like this, but that doesnt mean these traits are to be encouraged or glorified. these people should work on themselves to find better, healthier ways to go thru life and deal with situations and overall become better, kinder people. just like being a gaslighter and a manipulator isnt classified as a personality, but rather a toxic trait, so are pretty much all uniquely slyherin traits.

Would you attempt to become an Animagus? Why?,"Just wondering how many people in real life would want to attempt Animagus transfiguration if it existed. I absolutely would without a doubt. Most people would think being able to tranform into an animal at will would be pretty awesome and unique. However, the process is long, arduous, and highly dangerous. 

Below is the complete process to becoming an Animagus along with all warnings I could find. The process wasn't touched on much in the books but AFAIK, Rowling did release the Animagus process elsewhere. So take it as you will.

1. **Hold a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a whole month, from full moon to full moon**. You may not remove it at any point, not to eat, speak, or for any other reason you wish to remove the leaf. If you swallow it or remove it, you have to start over.
2. *At the end of the month***, spit out the leaf into a crystal phial, add one of your hairs, add one silver teaspoon of dew that has not been touched by human feet or sunlight in 7 days, and the chrysalis of a Death's-head Hawk Moth.** This is the potion you will drink at the end of all this. To repeat, the ingredients are: *your saliva soaked mandrake leaf, one of your hairs, one silver teaspoon of untouched dew, and one Death's-head Hawk Moth chrysalis.*
3. **Put the mixture in a dark, quiet place and leave it alone until the next electrical storm.** Don't check on it, don't look at it, don't disturb it in any way whatsoever. If you do, you have to start all over.
4. *While waiting for the storm,* **place your wand tip over your heart and recite the following incantation every sunrise and sunset: ""Amato, Animo, Animato, Animagus"".** If you forget one morning while waiting, you have to start again. I couldn't find anything regarding messing up the incantation but I presume that if you mess up, you have to start back at the leaf. *If you sense any difference (for example, a second heartbeat), do not change anything! Keep at it until the lightning storm.*
5. *Once a lightning storm occurs****,*** **retrieve the phial with the Animagus potion and move to an open space where you won't disturb anyone with your transformation.** I imagine the Great Hall would be an ideal location though if you happen to transform into a dragon then you might find yourself in a bit of a pickle. I think the best place would be a big open flat area outside away from any dangers (like the Forbidden Forest or Whomping Willow).
6. **Place your wand tip over your heart and repeat the incantation ""Amato, Animo, Animato, Animagus"" once more and drink the Animagus potion.** You will feel intense fiery pain and a double heartbeat. DO NOT PANIC! DO NOT BE AFRAID! Understandably, you will be afraid. Limit your fear. Try to remain as calm as possible. Failure to do so may result in ""the animal mind gaining ascendency"" and you could do something stupid or dangerous.
7. **Your creature's shape will soon appear in your mind. ""**You must show no fear/ It is too late now, to escape the change you have willed"".

If you mess up, even by forgetting to say the 4As incantation one morning, you'll forever spend days as a disfigured half human half animal monstrosity. So if you even think you might have screwed up, it is highly advised to start over. Better safe than horribly disfigured.

You don't choose your Animagus form. It's like your Patronus; it's chosen based on your personality and traits. In fact, if you want a less risky way to find out what your Animagus form will be, you can try casting a Patronus. They're not always the same but sometimes they are (McGonagall's Patronus and Animagus are the same). It may give you an idea at the very least.

You change back and forth by imagining the form you wish to transform into in your head.

You have to log yourself as an Animagus in the Animagus Registry. Failure to do so results in an Azkaban sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

So all of that is what's necessary to be an Animagus. So much can go wrong, the time that the whole process takes just increases the chances that something will go wrong. There's no undo button for an Animagus transformation; you fuck up, you're stuck forever. 

So, how many people would risk their lives and spend their time doing this?",0,"Would you attempt to become an Animagus? Why?

4. *While waiting for the storm,* **place your wand tip over your heart and recite the following incantation every sunrise and sunset: ""Amato, Animo, Animato, Animagus"".** If you forget one morning while waiting, you have to start again. I couldn't find anything regarding messing up the incantation but I presume that if you mess up, you have to start back at the leaf. *If you sense any difference (for example, a second heartbeat), do not change anything! Keep at it until the lightning storm.*
5. *Once a lightning storm occurs****,*** **retrieve the phial with the Animagus potion and move to an open space where you won't disturb anyone with your transformation.** I imagine the Great Hall would be an ideal location though if you happen to transform into a dragon then you might find yourself in a bit of a pickle. I think the best place would be a big open flat area outside away from any dangers (like the Forbidden Forest or Whomping Willow).
6. **Place your wand tip over your heart and repeat the incantation ""Amato, Animo, Animato, Animagus"" once more and drink the Animagus potion.** You will feel intense fiery pain and a double heartbeat. DO NOT PANIC! DO NOT BE AFRAID! Understandably, you will be afraid. Limit your fear. Try to remain as calm as possible. Failure to do so may result in ""the animal mind gaining ascendency"" and you could do something stupid or dangerous.
7. **Your creature's shape will soon appear in your mind. ""**You must show no fear/ It is too late now, to escape the change you have willed"".

If you mess up, even by forgetting to say the 4As incantation one morning, you'll forever spend days as a disfigured half human half animal monstrosity. So if you even think you might have screwed up, it is highly advised to start over. Better safe than horribly disfigured.

You don't choose your Animagus form. It's like your Patronus; it's chosen based on your personality and traits. In fact, if you want a less risky way to find out what your Animagus form will be, you can try casting a Patronus. They're not always the same but sometimes they are (McGonagall's Patronus and Animagus are the same). It may give you an idea at the very least.

You change back and forth by imagining the form you wish to transform into in your head.

You have to log yourself as an Animagus in the Animagus Registry. Failure to do so results in an Azkaban sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

So all of that is what's necessary to be an Animagus. So much can go wrong, the time that the whole process takes just increases the chances that something will go wrong. There's no undo button for an Animagus transformation; you fuck up, you're stuck forever. 

So, how many people would risk their lives and spend their time doing this?"

Things im expecting from Hogwarts Legacy,"1. I want to be a normal wizard exploring the wizarding world. This is not that important for me, but it would be cooler if i am a normal wizard, than a ""special boy"" like in hogwarts mistery.

2. Having Hogwats in its full size

3. I want to learn new things like new spells, potions etc and i want to use them theoughout the story. I mean, they should be useful and not just there to learn..

4. Good story, good characters, etc. .. as a good epg should be.

5. I want to have a house (geiffendor, etc.) were it feels good and rwlaxing to be there.

6. Good fights, i mean fights that not clunky or weird, just fights that fit the world

Some of the are more important than the others, but it would be nice if this game is as good as it sais. Maybe its kinda like Spider-Man, where the first games werent that good and the spider-man game of insomniac is good af...

Harry Potter and the Anime Tournament Arc,"Okay so, because of some plot there is now a magical Tournament at Hogwarts.  Here are the rules.  
1. The Head of each house has to choose 10 people who were / are in their house  
2. They Can summon students from the past even if they have past.  
3. They Can choose at what time to summon the person. So example. Lets say Snape went and got Jimmy from 1942. He could choose to get first year Jimmy or out of school middle age jimmy. (get it?)  
4. Once each house had the 10 members for each team, the games start, each team starting in their own Houses common room  
5. The Tournament lasts from 8pm to 6am  
6. You have to subdue someone, no killing is allow  
7. A barrier around the castle tells them how far they can go. If they go out of the  barrier, they are eliminated, also no one can get in (so no outside help)  
8. All magic, (besides they killing curse) is allowed, also broom and Apparition is allowed as well.  
9. Heads of House can not be  a part of the team, as they are the ""coach"" so no Snape, or Mcgonagall sadly. (but Dumbledore is allowed)  
10. Takes place during summer so no other students are in the castle.  
11. Only one person can be left  
12. If it comes to 6am and no one has one yet, the castle will start to get smaller, forcing the renaming wizards/witches closer.  
13. Winner gets one wish, whatever it may be.

Lupin seeing Harry for the first time,"When lupin woke up (in the dark) and made the dementor go away on the hogwarts express, he was reliving his worst memories, which probably involved losing James, and then he created a patronus, which probably involved using happy memories like running around with the marauders... then when the dementor left and he came back to reality he saw Harry (ie James in miniature) looking dead.

Farewell Aragog is such an important song to me,"A bit off topic, but this score from HBP is one of my favorite pieces of instrumental music that I've ever heard (second below Nemo Egg from Finding Nemo).

I've been learning how to play this song on the piano all day, (I can't really play piano, never learned), it's now almost 5 pm. I'm finally learning how to play this magnificent piece. It really sounds like losing a friend.

For the past month one of my best friends in the world, my 11 year old dog Izzy, was diagnosed with pancreatitis and has been doing poorly but kept bouncing back every few days. A little over an hour ago he was taken to the Emergency Vet Hospital by my family and I have to stay at home with my other two dogs. They told me there's a possibility he won't come back and won't make it and I'm just sitting here listening to Farewell Aragog and sobbing. I feel like Hagrid, losing such a great pet and friend. Please send any kind of good energy and luck (if religious, prayers are more than welcome too) my family's way.",0,"Farewell Aragog is such an important song to me A bit off topic, but this score from HBP is one of my favorite pieces of instrumental music that I've ever heard (second below Nemo Egg from Finding Nemo).

At Bill and Fleur's wedding..,"""Hello, Harry!"", (Luna) said. 

""Er- my name's Barny"", Harry flummoxed. 

""Oh, did you change that too?"" she asked brightly.

""How did you know-?"" ""Oh, just your expression.""

A very underrated scene in my opinion, because in the crowded atmosphere of the wedding you would have had a hard time finding Harry even if you knew what he looked like. How did Luna know it was him?

Cedric Diggory.,"So I'm re-reading the 4th and I'm sure that this has been brought up but Cedric Diggory DESERVED to live. Everyone always talks about how Cedric Diggory died for just being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

But whenever I'm asked this question I always Without a DOUBT say, Cedric. Yeah, we didn't get a lot of him but when I think about it he should be everyone's first choice to bring back. I mean Yes Fred's death was tragic but he MADE something he DID something. Meanwhile, Cedric never got the chance to have a career he was in his SIXTH year. He still had his 7th year and then the rest of his life. Fred had the Joke shop, Lupin and Tonks had Teddy, Sirius had Harry. But Cedric had nothing. He had done nothing.",0,"Cedric Diggory.

Dementors helped me understand my depression better,"I've always had depression starting from a young age, and I was never truly able to verbalize how exactly it felt until I read about dementors in the books and watched them being portrayed in the movies. 

Here is a quote about them that really struck a chord with me: 

""[Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can‚Äôt see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself ‚Äî soul-less and evil. You‚Äôll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/482565?ref=dementors)""

It also made me think about the time Ms. Figg testified about them during Harry's expulsion hearing in the OOTP movie: 

""Big, cloaked, then... everything went cold. As though all the happiness had gone from the world.""

But the ways wizards could fight dementors also helped me understand my depression a little better. Like how eating chocolate (I believe JKR was referring to comfort food, or just doing anything that brings you a tiny amount of joy), or thinking of your happiest memory (summoning your patronus) could ward them off. Even finally knowing the full meaning of the patronus spell Expecto Patronum (I await a guardian) gave me a lot of strong emotions. 

Anyway this post doesn't really have a clean conclusion... just that JKR could take something difficult to explain, especially for those who have depression, and express it in a perfect metaphor but also do it so poetically and beautifully. I also believe she was suffering from post-patrum depression and other mental health problems herself while she was writing the books, so maybe that's why the concept of dementors was so much more relatable to me.",0,"Dementors helped me understand my depression better I've always had depression starting from a young age, and I was never truly able to verbalize how exactly it felt until I read about dementors in the books and watched them being portrayed in the movies.

An alternate way to view the series: Harry Potter is a set of two trilogies connected by a middle book,"This is a fun way I've viewed the book series for a while and I thought it would be nice to share. The *Harry Potter* books are a series of two distinct trilogies (1-3, 5-7) connected by a middle book (4). Not only are there obvious differences in tone and atmosphere between the two, but there are also some really interesting plot threads and character/story beats that wrap up nicely in the trilogy format.

**The Wizarding World trilogy:** ***Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban***

* More of a focus on Harry's introduction to the whimsical world of witchcraft and wizardry with an overall light tone despite some dark elements
* These books are very much structured as *mystery* books, more so than the rest of the series. Each book starts with a mystery, often related to the book's title (who's after the Philosopher's Stone, who opened the Chamber of Secrets, who's the prisoner of Azkaban?), gives us an obvious answer that the trio pursue for most of the book (Snape is after the Philosopher's Stone, Malfoy opened the Chamber of Secrets, Sirius Black betrayed Harry's parents), and the true culprit is revealed in the third act after several hints throughout the book (Quirrell, Ginny, Peter Pettigrew). There are some mysteries in the later books (ex: who is the Half-Blood Prince?) but they are not made a huge focus like in this trilogy.
* The third act has a clear symmetry with who Harry is with. PS - he's with both of his friends and they get plucked off one by one. CoS - Hermione is hella stoned so Harry's with Ron. PoA - Ron is injured so Harry's with Hermione
* There is a clear theme of Harry's identity and his relationship with his parents and who he is in this trilogy. PS shows Harry finding out the truth of who he is as a wizard. CoS shows Harry confronting the truth of who he is as Voldemort's rival. PoA shows Harry confronting the truth of who he is as his parents' son. For an additional parallel, the PS book and film comments on Harry as James's son while the PoA film comments on Harry as Lily's son.
* There is a trilogy-long plot thread of Harry finding out the relationship between James and Snape. PS introduces the idea that Snape saved Harry's life because he owed a life debt to James. This is resolved in PoA when we find out exactly what that life debt was--James saved Snape from werewolf Lupin. Of course, we find out much later on that it was much more than that, but that still was an intentional story beat.
* There is a similarly trilogy-long plot thread of Gryffindors in the Quidditch cup. The trilogy builds up their wins and losses over the three years and culminates in them finally winning in the third book.

**The Wizarding War trilogy:** ***Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows***

* Much darker in tone and atmosphere and focuses on Harry's growth as a leader who inspires others and not just as a magical boy chosen one.
* Much less of a focus on the mystery element of the series and more on the politics of the world around them. They are no longer fun mystery books centered around a MacGuffin like finding the Philosopher's Stone before the bad guys do, but require more complex solutions like forming a secret group of disgruntled students to fight back against the corrupt system.
* Similarly to the first trilogy, this one also is quite poetic with who Harry teams up with in the finale. OotP - Harry leads a group of people for the first time and not just his two best friends. HBP - Harry is with Dumbledore alone. DH - Harry is by himself.
* The themes in this trilogy are a reflection of the themes from the first trilogy. While PS was about Harry entering the Wizarding world for the first time, OotP is about Harry seeing the corrupt world for what it is and learning how to fight back against it. While CoS was about Harry wrestling with his parallels with Voldemort, HBP was about Harry learning about Voldemort's past. While PoA was about Harry coming in terms with who his parents were (specifically his father's relationship with Snape), DH has Harry fully understanding who his parents were (specifically his mother's relationship with Snape).
* There is a trilogy-long thread of Harry's relationship with Dumbledore. While the first four books kept Dumbledore as a mostly background mentor figure, this trilogy puts their relationship on the forefront. OotP shows Dumbledore intentionally distancing himself from Harry and the cost that brings on Harry's mental wellbeing. HBP shows Dumbledore fully confiding in Harry and being his closest with him before dying in a clearly ""lowest point at the end of the second installment of a trilogy"" way. DH shows Harry living in a world without Dumbledore while finding out about his darker past and coming in terms with it all the same. 
* Unlike the first trilogy which are very episodic stories, this trilogy flows into each other so well as a trilogy with a clear overarching story across all three books, which works doubly in the films since those four movies had the same director.

***Goblet of Fire***

* Contains elements of both trilogies while also not neatly fitting in either, works to transition from one trilogy to the next
* Most of the story has several of the mystery elements and clearly still is a fantastical and whimsical view of the Wizarding World that was present in the first trilogy. In the background however, there is the creeping darkness of the second trilogy that comes to the forefront by the third act",0,"An alternate way to view the series: Harry Potter is a set of two trilogies connected by a middle book This is a fun way I've viewed the book series for a while and I thought it would be nice to share.

The dance between Harry and Hermione in Deathly Hallows part 1...,"Didn't understand this scene when I was younger, thought it was random and awkward, now that I am older I see that Harry wanted to take away her sadness for just one second. The scene captures the emotional anger Hermione was feeling, the tortured past of everything they've suffered, and Harry's inner wish to live in a world free from all the evil. The music is perfect and really captures the moment perfectly. This moment frozen in time would be one last chance at their 'schoolyard' friendship before the inevitable peril they knew was coming.

Love doesnt strike again?,"In my latest re-listen to the Deathly Hallows, when Voldemort is looking for gregorovich he goes to a family's house and a woman answers the door and tells Voldy that ""he no live here he move"" and 2 children come into the entryway and the mother throws herself in front of them. It's never confirmed if he kills everyone,  but if he killed the kids, would the same deep magic love that protected harry have protected those kids?

Draco Malfoy edit,"Hi everyone,

Please don't get annoyed at me if this is the wrong forum to put this on :)

So I made a Draco Malfoy edit recently, and I'm actually really proud of it. I posted it on YouTube for anyone who would like to see it :)

My YouTube is: ukizzy2006

It would mean a lot if you could even just check it out :) I showed my friends and family and they seem to be quite proud, especially my Dad. We are trying to promote it - he has reposted it on twitter and facebook and he's sent it to some of his friends as well. I'm quite an optimistic person - I don't wanna get my hopes up, because the likelihood is that nothing will really happen, but I always have that small hope inside of me that something does happen.

Thank you :)",0,"Draco Malfoy edit Hi everyone,

Muggle-born or half-blood?,"A friend and I got into discussion about blood status.

The hypothetical was: if a wizard (let's say Jasper) is born to a Muggle mother and father, but Jasper's mother's mother was a Squib whose parents were both magical, is Jasper considered Muggle-born or half-blood?

All opinions welcome.",0,"Muggle-born or half-blood? A friend and I got into discussion about blood status.

Where do you guys stand on Scorose?,"Ok so let me preface this by saying that I don't consider CC canon (as most do) and that everything is up for grabs. Simply I just wanted to ask what this subreddits feelings are generally towards Scorose. I am a bit on the fence. On one hand I think that it would never happen because they are Weasleys and Malfoys. I know many people like to stick to the ""he is not his father and he is a changed person"" schtick but in a realistic world, repentance doesn't always mean forgiveness. I mean it is the same as the son of a nazi falling in love with a jewish girl. Regardless if the two are blameless, the situation itself brings so much baggage and trauma that a relationship would never flourish. In a realistic world, a friendship would be more plausible between the two as opposed to a romance. I mean come on, Draco was absolutely brutal throughout the 7 books to the trio, he was a bystander while Hermione was tortured by his close family member, his father tried to kill dozens if not hundreds by releasing the diary and he became a death eater.

That being said, I also am not dead and cold inside. A part of me would like to believe in redemption and that the weasley's could see past Scorpius' parentage and see him for ""what he is"". Maybe it would be nice to see Rose connecting with someone who grew up in a different environment.

It think the part of me that likes Scorose is because of how much I like Romione. All fanfics that I've read (which aren't many though) have Rose and Scorpius be literally thematically IDENTICAL to Ron and Hermione. They bicker, bicker some more, bicker again and then BOOM, love. I'm sure this isn't an accurate representation of all Scorose fics but you get my point. In my head I could never see it working out but because of their resemblance to Romione and my ever romantic heart (lol idek), i think they could actually work.

Fan Theory: Hagrid helped Sirius Black escape Azkaban,"What we know: In 1993, Hagrid was sent to the wizarding prison, Azkaban, when he was accused if reopening the Chamber of Secrets. On the same night Dumbledore was asked to step down as Headmaster by the school governors, Hagrid was escorted to Azkaban. This was around the same time Sirius Black escaped from that same prison. 

Theory: Dumbledore knew Hagrid was innocent. He also knew Serius Black was innocent, and he saw the writing on the wall: He Who Must Not Be Named was making preparations for a return. In his infinite wisdom, Dumbledore enlisted Hagrid for a special mission, once again: aid in Black's escape. The details of Black's escape are unclear. We know Black took advantage of his extreme weight loss to slip through his cell door in his Animagus dog form, which the Dementors didn't recognize, and it is believed he swam across the sea. It's much more plausible he met up with Dumbledore's inside man, Hagrid, and when Hagrid's name was cleared (as Dumbledore surely knew it would) Black walked out of Azkaban posing as Hagrid's dog! Hagrid may not have even know who the dog really was. Too easy? That's almost exactly how Barty Crouch escaped a decade earlier, except using a polyjuice potion to look like his own dying mom.

For his reward on a successful mission involving the rescue of a magical creature, the following school year, Dumbledore made Hagrid the professor of the Care of Magical Creatures class.

It took the Azkaban prison guards several months to realize Black was missing, and announced his escape on 31 July.",0,"Fan Theory: Hagrid helped Sirius Black escape Azkaban What we know: In 1993, Hagrid was sent to the wizarding prison, Azkaban, when he was accused if reopening the Chamber of Secrets.

Was the tournment in Goblet of Fire supposed to be lethal?,"So I watched the part IV yesterday and there was that thing that made no sense to me. Was it considered that students might die in the trials?

That sounds dumb, because:

-Hogwart isn't some barbaric spartan camp. 

-The reaction to Cedric's death was pretty obvious, everyone was shocked, it was claimed to be a horrible accident. Sound like nobody was expected to die.

But on the other hand that approach makes no sense:

-Why was Harry called a hero when he saved the French student' sister? Why did he do that at all, if she wasn't actually in danger?

-Why did he mark the position of the girl in the maze if she wasn't in danger and wizards were surelly controling the thing.

-Why did Harry help Cedric with the ivy? If he wasn't in actual danger, why help him?

I'm not even mentioning the dragon fight since I just guess, wizards had some form of a spell that they could save the student in the last moment.

If anyone has more knowledge about the universe, please explain. Thanks in advance.",0,"Was the tournment in Goblet of Fire supposed to be lethal? So I watched the part IV yesterday and there was that thing that made no sense to me. Was it considered that students might die in the trials?

Dumbledore was an excellent character and piecing his journey together in the series where he went from a grey character to a good one is one the best part of the series.,"Now I want to clarify that I am not saying that Dumbledore was a good person but a good character. And he wasn't bad as I have read so many claim him to be. Yes, he was ambitious and aware of his intelligence. And he pretty much removed himself from his fellow peers and other characters and lead a lonely life, always guarding his secrets and playing people with half information so as to execute his plans. Even his plans with Grindlewald for the greater good were more him being misguided (even if I can justify the motive still what he was planning was evil). He just wanted a world where his sister could live freely and no one else had to go through what she did. And yes his major motivation was to be free from her responsibility. 

BUT after Ariana's death, he spent his whole life in remorse and repentance. There are so many instances of it. And although he didn't expect to he did love Harry.

I think JK Trolling made a great flawed character because his Intelligence and foresight made him nearly one of the most powerful character in the series and by seeing him fumble around in his teenage with the questions of power and morality and in his old age with remorse, made us question his decisions and his role in Harry's life.",0,"Dumbledore was an excellent character and piecing his journey together in the series where he went from a grey character to a good one is one the best part of the series.

"JK Rowling said homophobia, patriarchy and misogyny didn't exist in the Wizarding World. Here is why I disagree.","In most of the Wizarding homes, women seemed to stay at home as housewives and men would go out. Examples: The Weasleys, The Tonks, The Malfoys, etc. The only exceptions were younger people and Bellatrix. 

Pureblood families always favoured men and only they were heirs. Marvolo treated Morfin way better than Merope. Bellatrix was the oldest Black yet Sirius was the heir and when he was disowned it was Regulus.

The Lestranges used to show women as flowers on their family trees.

Women were shown as sexually very conservative, with the only exception of Bellatrix 

There is no way the Purebloods were not homophobes. Their main purpose of life was to create children so their family name went on. Homosexuality wouldn't have allowed this. This one could probably be only limited to Pureblood society and those who weren't part of it could be more accepting of gay people but Purebloods are the main representatives of the Wizarding World, being the oldest and purest families.",0,"JK Rowling said homophobia, patriarchy and misogyny didn't exist in the Wizarding World.

It's no coincidence they ran into Lockhart at Flourish &amp; Blott's,"It's established very early on in Chamber of Secrets that Mrs Weasley is a big Lockhart fan.

In this version, shamans actually outnumber the native american nomaj.

Memorias de Hogwarts,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a huge fan of all the HP related universe and constantly looking up for more history, like in videogames or so on.

So tho I‚Äôm not a fanfic person, about a couple of years ago I found this specific one called ‚ÄúMemorias de Hogwarts‚Äù. The bad thing it is in spanish only, since is written by this spanish girl who did it just for love for HP.

The history is so well written, it starts from the fifth year of hogwarts of James, Sirius, Lupin and Peter, also Snape, Lily, Lucius and so on appear in this . It has A LOT of basis from the information given in the HP books about this generation, along with post-books information that was revealed through interviews with JKR or pottermore stuff.

I‚Äôm highly against fanfic due to all the romance bullshit and fake relationships of Harry and Draco and wtf, but this specific one was like reading something written by the hand of JKR, very accurate with defined personalities according to the cannon, a lot of magic and action, a little romance obviously because it focuses on Lily and James, and how this derived in the formation of the OoTP, and has it‚Äôs ending with the killing of Lily and James. Also if you mashed it up together I think it would form at least three books like GoF. So there is a loooot to enjoy.

If you like the HP universe, speak spanish (sadly) and are (like me) always craving to read more, to keep the magic alive, this fic is seriously for you. Take it as a recommendation from a die-hard potter head.

They're saying something about the tracker being on Harry since he just turned of age. They can't do magic around him since it just alerts when magic is done where a minor is instead of the actual person themself - like when Dobby did magic and Harry got in trouble for it.

My question: How come any of the magic done at the Burrow during the visits didn't notify the tracker? Most of the kids were underage and the parents and older siblings were always using magic. Fred and George when they became of age did everything with magic. Mr and Mrs Weasley used magic all the time for cleaning and cooking and such. Wouldn't the tracker still be alerted with all the underage wizards in the house?

They can't do magic around him since it just alerts when magic is done where a minor is instead of the actual person themself - like when Dobby did magic and Harry got in trouble for it.

My question: How come any of the magic done at the Burrow during the visits didn't notify the tracker? Most of the kids were underage and the parents and older siblings were always using magic. Fred and George when they became of age did everything with magic. Mr and Mrs Weasley used magic all the time for cleaning and cooking and such. Wouldn't the tracker still be alerted with all the underage wizards in the house? And this goes for every wizarding house that had any underage wizards."

What house was the sorting hat contemplating for Seamus?,"In the books, page 120 TSS, the sorting hat takes different amounts of time for each person to be sorted. We see when it's Harry's turn that the hat is debating where to put Harry. When it is Seamus' turn though, Harry notices:

&gt;Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. ""Finnigan, Seamus,"" the sand-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a while minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.

We know from the next few paragraphs that the sorting hat takes into account the wearer's thoughts and wishes.

&gt;The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
Hmm,"" said a small voice in his ear. ""Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... So where shall I put you?""
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.
""Not Slytherin, eh?"" said the small voice. ""Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!""
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet.

The sorting hat takes just as much, if not more, time sorting Seamus as it did for Harry. So what was the hat thinking? It tells Harry that he could make a good Slytherin as well. So where do you think the hat was thinking of putting Seamus?

What if the Potterverse had 'Family Magic'?,"So if the concept of 'Family Magic' existed within the Potterverse, magical talents/gifts passing on to subsequent generations, what do you think the various 'Family Magics' would be?

With the Weasleys 'Fertility Magic' is the first to come to mind, but I also like the idea of 'Construction Magic' being their thing. The family having a tradition where once each child leaves home they go off and build their own home, and that is how The Burrow came to be.

With the Lovegoods Divination or Seer abilities(various magical senses) is the obvious thought.

In the case of the Dumbledores I would imagine some sort of 'Bee Magic' that allows them to tend to more bees or create larger hives and produce more honey; even brew their own brand of mead.

"Remember my last, Petunia","Why do people assume that the howler sent to Petunia in OotP refers to the letter Dumbledore left with baby Harry? I know assuming otherwise would be based on stuff not explicitly mentioned, but does it really make sense for it to refer to that one? Isn‚Äôt it more likely that he had sent her a howler between the regular letter in PS and the howler in OotP?
  
1)  Petunia does seem to know it is not an ordinary letter. She is afraid to open it. ‚ÄúShe looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route‚Äù does not sound like a person holding something they believe to be a normal letter in their hands.
  
2) She has never heard Dumbledore‚Äôs voice before unless she had at one point already received a howler from him.
  
3) Cryptocally referring back to a letter which was written over a decade ago - it seems a bit far fetched that Petunia would immediately know which ‚Äúlast‚Äù he was referring to.
  
4) Last kind of makes it sound like ‚Äúthe last same thing as this‚Äù as in the last howler. If someone says ‚Äúremember the last‚Äù on a TV show you‚Äôll probably assume they mean the last episode of the same show, not of some other show.
  
5) The letter seemed to frighten Petunia and had her immediately change her mind about kicking Harry out. I doubt the letter explaining Lily‚Äôs death and that she had to take in baby Harry was so incredibly threatening that it would still have such an effect on her...

"I think Ginny is less developed than a lot of the main cast, even in the books","Obviously, she's not as bland as her movie counterpart, because few things are. But even in canon, I feel like she's not given the level of characterisation that other characters have.

In the first three books, she has so little screen time that it's difficult to make any conclusions as to what her personality is. But in Goblet Of Fire, we start to get an image of her character. Not a lot, but we at least know she's sassy, kind and very impatient. It's in Order Of The Phoenix that I think her characterisation was at its best. She didn't take anyone's shit, had a clear presence for a good portion of the book and had some legitimately noteworthy moments.

But I feel like her writing from HBP onward could have used some work. In HBP, she's absolutely wonderful. So attractive that even the Slytherins talk about how pretty she is and so sassy that she has a vat of one liners every page. in my opinion, she's too wonderful. Her character traits are amplified to such a degree that she's almost seen as perfect and any character flaws that she does have are either overlooked or seen as endearing. Almost non-flaws. I kinda got the impression that she was written like that to make her relationship with Harry more satisfying, but for me, it did the opposite.

You could argue that she's seen that way, because the books are from Harry's point of view, but even disregarding his point of view, she still feels blander than she should be. Almost every member of the main cast has their negatives to balance out their positives, but Ginny feels more unbalanced to me. I'm not saying she has to be as fleshed out as the main trio, but I feel like there's more to say about characters like Neville and Luna than her. Maybe she should have been given more to do in the last book, because I don't think she's given a whole lot to do in that entry.

Is Aragog an Asshole?,"To clarify, I wondering if we can hold Aragog accountable for endangering Harry and Ron and for the behavior of his children after his death. Here's been my reasoning so far, augmented by the input of another redditor:

Asshole:
- He was raised by Hagrid, and while a 13 year old isn't the ideal parent, he would still have been introduced to morality during his upbringing.

- He is clearly capable of forming emotional connections and bonds, meaning we can't just excuse his behavior as being incapable of compassion.

- Most of the things we blame him for were perpetrated by his children, which he claims to not have a good hold over.

Not an Asshole:
- He might have a moral upbringing, but that couldn't have lasted more than a few years before he get dumped into the forbidden forest, and from there I'm kinda fuzzy on just how much contact he could have had with Hagrid. This means he might have not had as much time to adopt good values.

- He's not human, so he might feel justified in forsaking human values, especially given he did have contact with Acromantula society in the form of Morag.

For a book where love conquers all HP has a lot of traumatic &amp; failed loves.,"If you think about it there are quite a lot of failed &amp; traumatic relationships. I'm not sure if there are more successful &amp; happy ending ones or not. 

James &amp; Lily both die very young. 

Frank &amp; Alice Longbottom also both very young, tortured to insanity. 

Lupin finally finds someone to share his life with but both him &amp; Tonks die.

Snape unwittingly betrays his love &amp; lives in regret. 

Dumbledore loved a psychopath, that led to his sisters accidental death &amp; lives in regret.

Hagrid &amp; Madame Maxime never get together becoz of the shame of what they are &amp; likely will live their lives alone becoz they are half-breeds.

McGonagall  also never got to marry the man she loved &amp; her mother had to sacrifice living with her own magic kind to live with her Muggle husband in the Muggle world which made her quite sad.

Merope Gaunt desperately tries to win the love of Tom Riddle Snr but it all ends tragically. 

I know nobody feels sorry for her but Bellatrix did love Voldemort in her weird kinky sadistic way but he never cared about her. 

There's also some less significant break ups of Harry &amp; Cho which was weird with Cedric's death hanging over them.

Ron &amp; Lavender, which was a bit sad since she clearly was into him but Ron suddenly realises he loves Hermione. Heart-break. 

Dean &amp; Ginny. I feel like Dean was used here by Ginny to get Harry a bit jelly &amp; to start noticing her, but Dean was very mature about it all.",0,"For a book where love conquers all HP has a lot of traumatic &amp; failed loves.

What do you think about his performance as a DADA teacher? We have Book 6 and a scene from Book 3 to go by to evaluate how well he did.

Is there a counter-curse for lycanthropy?,"In Chamber of Secrets, in the DADA class immediately before Hermoine asks Lockhart for permission to use the restricted section, Lockhart dramatically recreates one of his ""adventures"" along with Harry, where he recalls how he performed a counter-curse in order to turn a werewolf back into a man. More importantly, the counter curse appears to be permanent and only needing to be applied once, as he supposedly left the village in a grateful state for delivering them from the monthly terror of that werewolf.

Later in the books, it is confirmed that Lockhart never actually did these things (something we had been suspecting the entire book). However, the important thing to keep in mind is that these things were indeed done, just not by Lockhart. Lockhart tracked down the witches and wizards who actually did these things, as well as the villagers they assisted, and modified their memories so he could take credit for their achievements.

So while Lockhart may not be able to perform a counter curse to change a werewolf back into a man, somebody out there sure as hell did.

Which means that such a spell necessarily must exist!

So why hasn't the instructions on how to perform this spell been widely circulated?! Why hasn't Lupin asked Dumbledore to perform it on him?!",0,"Is there a counter-curse for lycanthropy?

"What did Sirius mean when he said ""It makes things easier?""","On a first reading of Prisoner of Azakaban, everything Sirius does is meant to reinforce the idea that he wants to kill Harry, only for these actions to take on a whole new context on subsequent readings. When he opens Ron's bed brandishing a knife, the idea at first is that he just got the wrong bed and retreated for unknown reasons. On subsequent readings, it is clear that he knew it was Ron's bed he was attacking, and retreated because Scabbers was nowhere to be seen. When he keeps saying ""He's at Hogwarts"" while still in Azkaban, the implication is that ""he"" means Harry, and on subsequent readings, it's clear that ""He"" means Peter Pettigrew.

However, even on subsequent readings, there's one line of dialogue that doesn't make sense in this new light.

When Harry &amp; Hermoine arrive in the Shrieking Shack, Sirius says the following:

&gt;‚ÄòI thought you‚Äôd come and help your friend,‚Äô he said hoarsely. His voice sounded as though he had long ago lost the habit of using it. ‚ÄòYour father would have done the same for me. Brave of you, not to run for a teacher. I‚Äôm grateful ‚Ä¶ it will make everything much easier ‚Ä¶‚Äô

Make *what* easier? On a first reading, the idea is that not bringing a teacher with them would make *killing Harry* easier, and indeed, it is obvious how a lack of teachers present would make that a lot easier. On subsequent readings, we know he wants to kill Peter. But how exactly does not having a teacher with them make killing Peter easier? If anything, it just ends up screwing him over, since it means there are no credible eyewitnesses who can verify that Peter is actually still alive.

Goblet of Fire was a joy to read,"Like many I‚Äôm on my first serious read (as an adult that doesn‚Äôt remember the first go around) and I‚Äôve even refrained from tuning into the movies‚Äô reruns to make use of my bad memory and have fresh-ish eyes.

Just finished Goblet of Fire and it was so good! So nuanced! The entire ordeal with The crouches kept me on my toes even if I already knew the big twist and the chapter in the graveyard was so heavy. Cedric‚Äôs and Harry‚Äôs sportsmanship was such a nice touch for their characters... The tones of found family with Molly and Harry almost had me tearing up and the foreboding of the last days in Hogwarts, knowing the war is now upon them and their playful childhood is positively over... it‚Äôs a very strong book.

My main issue with the series continues to be the obvious bias of painting every single mention of Slytherin under villainous intentions,  Draco and his gang were really working hard in this one, Jesus Christ. It occurred to me that Percy would‚Äôve been a perfect Slytherin but then, JKR would‚Äôve burst a vessel trying to keep the rest of the Weasleys from disowning him.

Looking forward to order of the Phoenix! I remember next to nothing outside of big plot points! Such fun.

Ravenclaw Interhouse Challenge -,"#Challenge

Marietta Edgecombe here - I have created this special task force from the within the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Muggles have created some very interesting technologies that, according to our research, require the use of some sort of web. We are unclear what creature created this web (a new breed of spider perhaps?) but it seems to almost magically connect people from around the world for global communication. Given the usefulness of this kind of communication in lieu of traditional wizarding owls and such we are tasking you with testing these web-based outlets. My supervisor, Griselda Marchbanks, is particularly interested in this testing and will be checking in as well.

---

#Logistics

Houses will be required to collectively run social media accounts for two characters from the Wizarding World, on Twitter and Instagram. These characters must be decided upon collectively. One must either be a confirmed member of your house, or an officially unsorted but potential member. The other must be a character from a different house of your choosing, or an unsorted potential member of another house.

Accounts must be kept active and in-character throughout the month, must follow all r/harrypotter and Reddit rules and must interact with each other. Images posted must be either original content or wizarding variations on common memes. On occasion, Marietta Edgecombe of Ravenclaw will throw situations at your characters, and they will be judged on how well each challenge is handled. Her new boss might just look in on occasion to see how she‚Äôs getting along. The first situation will be the same for each house, but the second and third will be tailored to your characters and interactions to date.

For reference, we are considering this to be taking place in 2019 to avoid the issue of having some people roleplay students from the books and some roleplay adult versions of people the same age.

---

#TIMELINE

* Houses will have until 11:59 PM EST on 5th October to inform Ravenclaw of their character selection and the reasoning behind it. If you select an unsorted character, we want to know why you think that character might be a member of the house they are representing. You will also need to provide us with the names of two official house representatives for purposes of communication.
* Ravenclaw will confirm character selections with house representatives by 11:59 AM EST 6th October. In the event that more than one house selects the same character, preference will be given to the house (if any) that is the canonical home of the character. After this, selection will revert to a first-come-first-serve basis. In the event of a clash, the other house(s) will be required to make an alternative selection. We recommend having a backup or two on hand for cases like this. Houses will have until 11:59 PM EST on 6th October to provide their new name(s).
* Profiles will need to be set up and links sent to Ravenclaw by 11:59 PM EST 7th October. Ravenclaw will follow each account.
* Accounts will be run between 7th and 27th October. Three situations or events will be presented to you on the 12th, 18th, and 24th October.
* Houses will be scored by a selection of Ravenclaw judges who will each give a score out of five(5) in each of the following areas:
 * Creativity of character selection
 * Creativity/effort of profile creation (username, profile picture, etc.)
 * Accuracy of character
 * Accuracy of house portrayal
 * Solutions to situations (one score for each)
 * Activity across all accounts

Each judge will then have a rating out of 40 points. Cumulative scores will determine first, second, and third place in the challenge. Final scores will be announced by 11:59 PM EST 31st October.

***First place - 250 points

It makes no sense that Hermionie didn't get an O on the DaDa OWL.,"IDK if the thinking was to demonstrate that Harry was better at it than even she was, that seems likely, BUT.

She got an O on Everthing else, its sort of her baseline. She's always gotten the highest grades possible. So she's already putting in that same Outstanding level effort into DADA anyway.

But on top of that, she also did a bunch to help Harry prepare for the Triwizard tournament. That practice with her is arguably one of the crucial things that got Harry really good at DADA in the first place.

And then she was ALSO in the DA, where its implied that Harry was an exceptional teacher getting many of his classmates through the DADA OWL when they otherwise may not have.

For all the practice she got in being Harrys friend and getting dragged into all of his mess, DADA should have been one of Hermionies better subjects.

"Favourite things (parts, scenes...etc) in CC for those who have seen the play. (CC Spoilers)","Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

After reading the script a few years ago, I finally had the opportunity to see the Melbourne Production in all its glory. I know the plot was not the best plot to man (it was possibly the most critically panned plot in the fandom on the same level as McGonagall appearing in CoW). The play itself was magical and seeing how all the scenes played out, the magic and the clever transitions definitely brought a smile to my face.

I would like to ask you, what was your favourite scenes or parts in the play as you watched it. If you don't have a favourite scene, what stood out positively for you?

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I could name a few things

\- Scorpius ... He was my favourite character in the play... he was so much more dorky on stage

\- Rose Granger Weasley despite being not the best character in the play was able to emit Hermione's more arrogant and goody-goody personality during the 1st year segment. 

\- The Sorting Hat sorting. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIhqGlkOYyw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIhqGlkOYyw)

\- Scorpius's vent!

\- The Dementors appearing in the Part 1 Finale

\- AU Ron and Hermione admitting their love and then getting kissed by dementors before floating away.

\- Snape turning to the Dementors, raising his arms to allow the Dementors to kiss him.

\- The Unforgivable Curses when they hit are displayed in slow motion while normal spells like Incendio or Wingardium Leviosa are much quicker. Seeing Scorpius being tortured was definitely something I can't forget... oh and Avada Kedavra being shown as a green flame before Craig dies.

\- Cedric meeting Scorpius and Albus and assuming they were tasks.

\- The flashbacks to young Harry, my favourite being the Godric's Hollow Nightmare with Petunia... before that jumpscare

\- James and Lily having their walk with baby Harry in the pram. You could see how at peace they were despite being in hiding.

\- Lily putting Harry's blanket in the pram and meeting Scorpius. He waves to her and she waves back before walking off.

\- Harry and co witnessing James and Lily's death and describing it. Hearing James, Voldemort and Lily's dialogue off scene brought tears to my eyes. DID YOU KNOW: On the first rehearsal, the actors for James, Lily and Voldemort acted out the scenes in front of Harry and co. That brought out more emotional impact most certainly.

\- Hagrid appearing in Godric's Hollow and finding young Harry.

Harry's Patronus,"Hello everyone. I already posted this a while ago but unfortunately the discussion didn't really happen. But it's a thing that has been bothering me for a while so I'm asking my question again:

&gt;I've been wondering about that for a while now:

&gt;It's a widely known fact, that none of the Deatheaters was able to create a Patronus. How is it possible that Harry, who isn't a Deatheater but much more, a Horcrux of Voldemort, is able to get one?

Just remember how much Harry, Ron and Hermione were influenced in DH when they took care of the Horcrux. None of them would have been in the condition to create a Patronus. How could Harry, who was always near a Horcrux (himself) be able to create his? 

&gt;Maybe I missed something, but it's been bothering me for a couple of days now... Thanks for your thoughts!",0,"Harry's Patronus Hello everyone.

Quidditch Cup has way more weight to it than the House Cup,"Don't get me wrong, winning the House Cup it's a really nice achievement, acknowledgement of one house being over-all best during a single school year. The winning house also gets to have the Great Hall decorated with their crest and colors during the end-of-the-year feast *and rub it in the face of their rivals* (especially when it comes to Gryffindor and Slytherin). But, other than that...

Winning Quidditch Cup is a huge accomplishment because of a single simple reason - *the whole point of Quiddich, like any other sport, is to win.* No one is playing Quiddich at Hogwarts because he/she wants to learn to be a good flyer or improve keeper skills, no, *only the best* flyers and *most skilled* players get to be on the team. *It's a team competition*, so the success can hardly be achieved by a single player. Since there are only three games for each team, each of those games is extremely important and each and every team prepares for those. If someone doesn't behave or sabotages the chemistry, *he gets removed from the team*.

On contrary, students *don't* attend Hogwarts with a goal of winning a House Cup. They come to study, improve their abilities and earn degrees in order to pursue a specific career. *Earning points just follows as a result.* Also, houses *don't* think of themselves as teams. There hasn't been a single occasion when Gryffindors rounded-up before a Herbology lesson and said *""Guys, today is the day, we've been practicing for weeks, today we need to be better than Slytherins at repotting Mandrakes!""*. No, some students are always prepared for a lesson and eager to show it, while others simply don't care. Those who don't care or regularly break the rules *can't* be removed from the house.

And then, **the points**.

In Quidditch, if you catch a Snitch, your team gets 150 points. If you score a goal, your team gets 20 points. And it's *a rule*,  it's always those numbers, it doesn't matter who is the referee.

On the other hand, teachers can give or take house points *however they please*. Giving a correct answer will get you 10 points from Sprout and zero or *even negative* points from Snape. Snape will *favor* his students and refuse to punish them for rule-breaking, while McGonagall will punish them twice as harshly *because* they are her students. It's just pointless.

It's like a difference between a serious competition and a mess without any rules.

Harry‚Äôs Sacrifice Ideas,"We all know Harry‚Äôs willing sacrifice cast the same spell on everyone he loved at the Battle of Hogwarts, that Lily cast on him ‚Äúthat night in Godric‚Äôs Hollow‚Äù. 

So on that premise, is it plausible that Bellatrix didn‚Äôt miss Ginny, but instead Harry‚Äôs sacrifice saved her from the Killing Curse.  

The same goes for Molly when she steps up to ‚ÄúNOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH!‚Äù all over Bellatrix, she doesn‚Äôt fair well at the start, but then gains the upper hand, once Bellatrix STOPS ATTACKING, I believe that Bellatrix (most of all) wouldn‚Äôt stop until she knew they would die, and the last spell she sent towards Molly was a Killing Curse, ‚ÄúBella‚Äù expected her to die which is why she stopped attacking and allowed Molly to gain the upper hand, Molly was the closest thing to a mother Harry had (maybe except McGonnagal), so is that a reasonable reason why she bested one of Voldemort‚Äôs most powerful death eaters in a duel? She was under the same spell as Ginny.

Cause at the end of the day, Harry didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlove‚Äù everyone at the ‚ÄúBoH‚Äù which is why it‚Äôs important to figure out who it was his sacrifice saved. Obviously there‚Äôs Ron, Hermione, Ginny (as the 3 certain options), then there is people like Minerva, Molly Weasley, Neville, Luna and Seamus. 

Remember Minerva was sent flying by LORD VOLDEMORT in a fit of RAGE, after Bella‚Äôs death. Which isn‚Äôt that ‚Äúbad‚Äù but she‚Äôs not a young woman, she was almost killed by 4 stunning spells so surely it‚Äôs plausible that a force produced purely of rage by LORD VOLDEMORT, would do serious damage, but she was ‚Äúrelatively fine‚Äù.

How Would You Like To See The Harry Potter Re-boot?,"Once the FB movie series is over, maybe by 2030, Warner Bros. will probably look to reboot Harry Potter. As much as I love the movies, I knew movies could never do this story justice. What it deserves is a television series, like Game of Thrones. A series, with a high budget, would be able to flesh out so much more than the movies were able to show. The marauders, more of Voldemort's memories, more depth into the side characters. However, the one thing that will never be matched is the excellent cast of the movies. That would be one thing the tv series would lack in. But if they put enough effort and money behind the tv series, I think it could be spectacular. 7 seasons. 6-8 episodes per season, maybe 10 for the last few. A high budget, so we can see the full display of the magic and creativity of JK's world. What are your guy's thoughts?

Hermione was key to Harry in always being loyal and keeping him on track but I think the smaller friendship moments with Ron were equally important in stopping Harry from comppletly cracking or breaking down entirely.,0,I don‚Äôt think Harry could have survived emotionally without Ron I love their friendship and we see how miserable Harry is whenever he and Ron aren‚Äôt on speaking terms.

"My very first visit to Wizarding World of Harry Potter was in Japan on my birthday last Nov. I had butterbeer instead of cake that day and it was the best. I wouldn't trade it for any cake except Hagrid's cake maybe. üòÇüòÇ Unfortunately, I wasn't chosen at Ollivander's. It would've been great tho.",,0,

Harry Potter themed tea for my girlfriend.,"Bought three kind of tea leaves and named them after the dragons of the TriWiz tournament. Names are in the italian translation becouse they sound more exotic like that (and also we're italian).  
Petardo Cinese (Chinese Fireball) is a oolong chinese tea.  
Verde Gallese (Welsh Green) is a green tea.  
Ungaro Spinato (Hungarian Horntail) is a black tea.

Just a some of my thoughts on how Hagrid could be more useful :),"I want Hagrid to sit on my face and fart down my throat, preferably against my will. In the movies, we've seen that Hagrid has a lot of strength, so it should be effortless for him to overpower anyone and forcibly sit on their face. Then, he would rip one. I'm not talking about regular farts. I'm talking about the kind of fart that has you walking like a penguin to hold it in, the kind of fart that makes you zone out because all attention has to be placed on tightening your ass crack, the kind of fart that makes you wonder if you shat yourself, the kind that makes you say ""ahh"" once it's over. That kind of fart. That is what I want, down my throat, multiple times. If I'm lucky enough, one of his butt hairs will fall off from the intense air velocity and choke me to (a wonderful) death. I'm not embarrassed to say I've lost litres of cum to this thought many times.

Not having any quidditch is GoF was stupid. Reasons below? What do people think?,"Each team only plays 3 matches so it could be played off in 3 weeks. So the argument that they needed the quidditch pitch for the final task doesn't really matter. They could have a month's training and then play it. 
As a sports person I would be pissed off that one champion from Hogwarts causes the whole quidditch season to be cancelled. 
It would have been better if Dumstrang and Beauxbatons actually got involved and played against each house.( Krum v Potter would be cool) 
Also i know the JKR left it out because the book would have been too long. But just something I feel can be discussed.",0,"Not having any quidditch is GoF was stupid. Reasons below?

Dumbledore as Headmaster of Hogwarts,"What does Dumbledore actually do as Headmaster of Hogwarts. The Professors plan their own curriculum and it seems like he doesn't really hold staff meetings among them.  I assume he doesn't prepare any performance appraisals or a few Professors would be out of a job. What does he do on a day to day basis as a Headmaster? Seems like he has quite a lot of free time.

I'm not saying he was a bad Headmaster since he was probably the only one qualified to protect the school from Voldemort but how does he justify his daily tasks to the school board?

Unpopular Opinion: Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood isn't that great,"I just got back from my first time there and honestly... was underwhelmed. Maybe Orlando or Tokyo is better but here's my rundown:

&amp;#x200B;

Attractions:

1. Flight of the Hippogriff is an extremely tiny rollercoaster that lasts about 20 seconds and not once gives you the ""dropping"" feeling in your stomach
2. Ollivander's is a place where you stand in in line for 40 minutes to watch someone else recreate the scene where Harry gets his wand.
3. The Forbidden Journey is neat because it mixes a simulator with dark room like qualities, but isn't enough of an ""A-List"" attraction to draw people to the area.
4. It's neat to walk around but you'll be done in about an hour or less depending on how much shopping you wanted to do.
5. The butterbeer is tasty but essentially cream soda with butterscotch.
6. Honeydukes has a rather lackluster selection of candies and they're extremely expensive. With how much they mention in the books you'd think they'd have more variety.
7. Maybe I'm crazy, but because they've gone with Hogsmeade rather than Diagon Alley there's a bunch of little continuity errors about shops/locations that bug me (lol)..

Rewatched the GoF and...,"It's pretty garbage. Here's my list:

* First off, the way they tease the Quidditch World Cup is just plain mean. I understand time constraints but c'mon.

* The ""fight"" with the dragon - waste of time! No one wanted to see that, it doesn't even make sense. 

* no S.P.E.W subplot/winky subplot

* no Percy subplot

* Harry is consistently an asshole through the whole movie, especially to Neville before the first task

* Crouch Jr's tongue tic is just plain stupid

* Dumbledore acts like a douche pretty much the whole movie

Redeeming factors to me (there aren't many)

* David Tennant is a good actor 

* Comedic relief at certain points, like Filch with his poorly timed cannon shots 

* Rita Skeeter is as annoying in the movie as she is in the book

So yeah, I honestly think it's the worst out of the 8 movies. PoA is pretty terrible as well though.",0,"Rewatched the GoF and... It's pretty garbage. Here's my list:

As many HP fans of a certain age might confirm, there's a lot of nostalgia surrounding the franchise for people who grew up with the books as they were being released. /r/VintageHarryPotter is a new sub that serves as a community for people to engage with posts specifically about Harry Potter from this earlier period ‚Äì the period I've called the ""Crimson Age"" of HP, between the release of the first book in 1997 and the release of the last book in 2007 (this is definitely flexible). I know those types of posts are welcome here, as well, but I wanted to create a space dedicated specifically to old-school HP, since I love seeing posts from the early days of the series. Things like old book release announcements, behind-the-scenes footage from the early films, early merchandise, interviews with the cast when they were kids, old interviews with Jo Rowling, footage and photos from the book launch parties and midnight screenings of the films, etc.

To be honest from the little snippets and screenshots we got, it look like it would of been one of the coolest games released in a while.

I only just discovered that this was a thing due to getting back into Harry Potter recently, but I am curious if we have any more details about the game.",0,"Any news on that alleged Harry Potter RPG that leaked late last year?

Here is why I think an eagle is a perfect representation for Ravenclaws...,"First, as some already know: an eagle‚Äôs claws are raven colored. I think that‚Äôs pretty clever and shows random knowledge that I feel Ravenclaws would love to share. 

Secondly, I did a lot of research on the symbolism of Eagles. Most of it was related to Native American culture, and who knows how much thought JKR really put into this. But here‚Äôs what I have found:

‚ÄúEagles symbolize awareness, the ability to see from a vantage point that is reserved for a very few.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a spirit animal, the eagle satisfies one of the basic hungers of the human soul - the search for the awesome and mystical [...] It offers us wisdom from these higher planes, and it brings us answers to the heavier questions of life.‚Äù

‚ÄúEagle people are visionaries, those who are seekers and who are willing to push the limits of self-discovery and personal freedom.‚Äù

These excerpts, along with much more that I‚Äôve read, shows me that eagles are very great representations for our house as we too are seekers of wisdom and knowledge.  Many inventors and innovators came from Ravenclaws, showing we tend to have a greater desire to push the boundaries of what we know, being visionaries, just as our mascot represents. 

I‚Äôd also be fine with the raven having been our mascot for obvious reasons from previous arguments.

Lucius Malfoy Cane+Wand?; Birthday gift ideas for my friend,"Greetings! I've been lurking this subreddit for the past four years or so, but never have made any posts. So hello! I hope this sort of post is allowed.

My friend who's recently become a fan of the series is currently obsessed with Lucius Malfoy. Her birthday is towards the end of October and I've been looking around for any merch of his cane &amp; wand, but the official one I found is quite pricey.  Are there any other options others might know of?  Or anything Lucius related I could get for her? If I can't find anything then I was considering buying her a few mystery wands, but that's always hit or miss. Or just some funko pops. I'm already drawing some art of him for her, so she will have that at least.

I would very much appreciate any help on this! Thanks for reading! Apologies if I did anything wrong, I'm not sure what flair to use so please let me know if I need to fix anything on this post.",0,"Lucius Malfoy Cane+Wand?; Birthday gift ideas for my friend Greetings!

Best Harry Potter villain,"Hi y'all

I have to say my favourite has to be Bellatrix. Shes crazy and evil but i have to give her mad respect for devoting her whole life to something she so strongly believes in. Like imagine if she was in the Order of the Phoenix, she could have been one of the best aurors. 

ANWAYS from a general perspective she fights for what she believes in and she would do anything for the people she loves. lowkey sounds like a crazier and more dark version of Harry...

For the worst villain, it would most definitely 110% have to be Dolores Umbridge. She is evil dressed in pink. She sneakily hides her true desires for pain under the guise of following the Minister's orders. At least Voldemort and Bellatrix are true to who they are. Umbridge abuses her power and positions herself where many are too afraid to stand up to this foul woman.

Ron was the worst character,"hi y'all.

Look I love the golden trio TOGETHER- but Ron as an individual character is just horrid.

First of all, he is insanely insecure which is due to his large family, however I believe that this doesn't excuse his behaviour and treatment towards others. Speaking from personal experience, you need to learn how to leave your mental baggage at home or be able to talk about it! Hermione shouldn't need to explain his problems to Harry cause last time I checked Ron is very capable of speaking for himself. But he just doesn't have the balls to. I understand that I'm probably sounding insensitive and stuff but I don't see Hermione or Harry having major flaws that actively affect their dynamic.

Secondly, his jealousy causes him to say cruel things. Like in the Goblet of Fire, he assumed Harry wanted the glory and ignored him causing Harry to be placed in much more unneeded stress, especially since Rita and Draco were giving him a hard time. A good friend would recognise this and place their problems aside and support their friend because that's more important than them lying to you. He also acts very hypocritically towards the whole Hermione-Krum situation. He asks Hermione to the Ball in a very underwhelming and degrading way and then gets pissed off because she's going with Krum! Why didn't he ask her sooner, if he wanted to go to the Ball with her so badly, or even man up and tell Hermione how he feels about her. He is especially frustrating when he goes around kissing Lavender and strings the poor girl along because he wants to make Hermione jealous. He completely uses Lavender who geniunely likes Ron and gets her heart broken, because some ginger boy can't express his feelings!

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, Ron wants fame and he wants to be glorified but he doesn't do anything about it. He could be working hard in school and actually putting effort in his work, but instead wants to cheat of Hermione. Maybe if he actually tried he could be recognised and praised in class like Hermione or even practice quidditch so that he can be captain (like what he saw in the Mirror) or possibly a world star player. He could be actually doing something to achieve these  things and to finally gain the approval and recognition he craves instead of mopping around and being the jealous, toxic friend he is!

Who had the most tragic life??,"Hi y'all big time potterhead here!! I've loved the books and i've grown up with them, I've just found this youtube channel called MovieFlame where they go indepth for all the characters full life stories and I must say some have had it worst than others. This channel has also caused me to strongly dislike dumbledore now (he was insensitive and sneaky) and I've always hated ron!( he's just jealous and insecure). Obviously Harry is my alltime favourite but my others have the saddest lives. here they are:

1. Sirius Black: Man where do i begin? He grew up in a family that didn't accept his dislike for dark magic and therefore made many attempts to run away which ultimately caused his parents to try and burn him off the family tree which is possibly one of the worst things a parent could do. At least when he came to Hogwarts he found his best friends and found his calling to fight the evil in the wizarding world. However, this would soon change in October of 1981 when Lily and James were murdered at the hands of Lord Voldemort who was informed by Petter Pettigrew one of his best friends. And if that couldn't get any worse! He got blamed for it and for Peter's 'death'. Imagine being locked away in Azkaban with your soul literally being sucked away for the murder of your best friends, which you didn't commit. Then when he did escape, he was still labeled as a murder and traitor. Finally when Lupin and the Golden trio did discover the truth he was sent away to the home he was never welcome in. He wasn't allowed to leave and felt like he wasn't any use to the order. He was eventually killed by his own cousin. That sounds like a pretty tragic life to me
2. Severus Snape: This man had it ruff. When he was a boy, he didnt have the most loving upbringing but at least it wasn't as bad as others. He approached Lily when he noticed she showed signs of magical ability. her sister Petunia made fun of him and lily and called them cruel names. But at least he had a friend. But, at the sorting, lily was placed in Gryffindor and him in Slytherin. Throughout their Hogwarts years, Severus was relentlessly teased by James and Sirius, which only pushed him further down the path of dark magic that all Slytherin's seemed to be destined for. The bullying was humilating for him and in a moment of anger told Lily, his only real friend and love of his life that she was a 'filthy mudblood'. After this, she never forgave him. Like destined, Severus followed down the familiar death eater path, and unfortuntely relayed information to Voldemort of the prophecy. When he realised that this prophecy could be about Lily's son he turned to Dumbledore for help in return for Snape to become a double agent for the order. However, the Potter's placed their trust in the wrong person, which caused their deaths, Snape went to the potter's house and held Lily's dead body. the body of the only person he truely loved and cared for. Dumbledore told Snape to protect Harry, which he didn't find out the reason why until later on. Because of his promise to do anything for Dumbledore Snape wasn't trusted and caused other order members to be wary of him. Because of his promise to Dumbeldore and the unbreakable vow he made, he killed Dumbledore to prove his 'loyalty' to Voldemort and spare Draco's soul. Once again, the wizarding community viewed this man as a villian and another death eater. Finally, when he was killed by Nagami, Harry discovered how brave Snape had been by putting his life on the line to gather intel on Voldemort and how he only ever acted on Dumbledore's command. He risked his life to do good and to make up for the many mistakes he had made, and for Lily to hopefully forgive him one day.
3. Remus Lupin: I've got to admit I cried at his death: As a young boy he was bitten by Greyback in retailation for a crude comment his father had made about werewolfs when questioning them at the Ministry. This caused Lupin to be in immense pain every full moon and to put himself and others in danger. THis caused his parents to shelter him away from the other children and caused him to very lonely and isolated. However, all this changed when he got his acceptance letter to Hogwarts, where he met his best friends who accepted him for who he was and even transformed themselves into Animagus so he wasn't alone and wouldn't harm them during his transformations. He lived a happy life serving in order with his best friends, until James and 'Peter' were killed adn sirius was thrown in Azkaban responsible for the crimes. Again, Lupin was alone with no one in his life. However, this changed when he was offered a teaching position at Hogwarts, he was reluctant at first but agreed, he was happy to be with people again. During this year, he learnt that Peter was still alive and that Sirius was innocent, unfortuntely he transformed, which caused peter to escape and sirius and harry to be captured. Luckily, Harry and Hermonie freed Sirius and Buckbeak. Lupin quit teaching as he was ashamed and afraid of the constant danger that he poses. While serving in the order he met Tonks and they hit it off. He assumed that she was into Sirius but was shocked when she confessed her feelings for him, but he refused for someone to love him. She persisted however and they conceived. Lupin was still very ashamed of being a werewolf and how it may damage her and her families social status decided to run away and fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. He and Tonks both died that day, leaving their baby son, Teddy to  be an orphan. Lupin treasured his friendships, but struggled to accept himself and Tonk's unwavering love for him.

Voldemort was a dumbass.,"Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, last blood of the Gaunt family. When it came to horcruxes though, he was an idiot. Why? I'll list it.

1. The Horcruxes themselves. Tom Riddle had six intentional horcruxes, and every last one was a dumb item to stash a soul in. Let's run down the list, eh? A diary with his name embossed on it. A ring containing the resurrection stone, and known to be connected to the Gaunts, last pure heirs of Slytherin. A locket, diadem, and goblet, all priceless artifacts of the magical world everyone knows about. And a snake that he always keeps with him, and is completely mortal. The problem here is that A: Everyone knows about these or can connect them to Voldemort.

2. The Hiding places. Let's see, Malfoys. Most arrogant and idiotic of your followers. Gaunt Shack, a known connection to Slytherin, and by extension you. Gringotts, no comment. Hogwarts: Are you truly so stupid as to believe only you would ever discover the room of requirements? Inferius Cave; probably one of the highest concentrations of magic in Britain. By your side, easily seen and hated, who wouldn't jump at the chance to kill it? And all are connected to you somehow, you idiot.

3. How to improve: Watch, and learn.

Diary, Malfoys: Stone, Bottom of the Aegean Sea.

Ring, Gaunt Shack: , Priceless Mural (any of them), Louvre, France

Locket, Inferius cave: limestone stalactite, Carlsbad Caverns, USA

Diadem, Hogwarts: Sandstone piece, Uluru/Ayers Rock, Australia.

Is there a limit to reparo?,"Ok this is pretty out there but I was thinking about Reparo (and the variant Oculus Reparo) and like. How complex of an object is it capable of fixing. Does casting the spell necessitate knowledge of the construction? 

Ok a few examples: 

We already know Reparo can fix basic tools. If you busted a knife blade or axe fixing it would put it back. 

What about an internal combustion engine? As per above, would a wizard with a schematic of the engine yield a different result? 

And finally: would Reparo fix your iPhone? If it's just a cracked screen? Water damage? Battery gave out? What if you ran over it with a car? 

While I'm personally inclined to believe magic and technology are inherently at odds, there are plenty of examples in the series to indicate otherwise (like everyone's favorite Ford Anglia).

Hufflepuff - the mediators,"Everyone knows that Gryffindors are brave. We all agree that Ravenclaws are intelligent. Slytherins are ambitious. But what about Hufflepuffs? 


‚ÄúStudents belonging to this house are known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial.

Unlike the other houses, you don‚Äôt need a particular trait to belong in Hufflepuff. You need not be brave like a lion, intelligent as a raven or cunning like a snake. 
You CAN be - Cedric Diggory was both brave, brilliant and ambitious - but what defines a Hufflepuff is not his abilities, but his heart. We are the mediators. We are the diplomats, the caretakers. We enjoy life, we smile a lot and we love fiercely. 

Hufflepuff is ‚Äúthe least selective‚Äù house, and for that reason people might think that it is a house for lesser talented students. But in fact, we are very much selective. We just don‚Äôt select based on bravery, intelligence, personal ambition or indeed magical abilities. To become a Hufflepuff you must be pure of heart.

Really, we are a very varied bunch. We don‚Äôt share an age, a reading style, a nationality, a gender, or a brain.

Some of us have read all the books and seen all the movies. Others have only seen the movies or only read some of the books or any combination of those two.

Our favourite book may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

We may find Hermione annoying, or Ron bratty, or Ginny under-written, or Harry weak, but then again we may feel the reverse is true.

Our favourite description of food may be the Christmas feast, the chocolate frogs, the pumpkin juice, the butterbeer, or Florean‚Äôs ice cream sundaes. Or something else entirely.

Our favourite House may be Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, or Ravenclaw.

We may love Snape and see him as a hero, or a bully, or both.

Our favourite teacher may be McGonagall, Snape, Dumbledore, Hooch, or Hagrid. Or someone else entirely.

If we‚Äôve read or seen¬†The Cursed Child, we may love it or loathe it or find it problematic but interesting.

Our favourite spell may be expelliarmus, Ginny‚Äôs bat bogey hex, riddikulus, or sectumsempra. Or something else entirely.

How do you think Voldemort would react if he found out Harry was his last surviving Horcrux?,"Would he still try to kill him?

I know he could try to create more and he probably could, but there's some guesswork (to me) that suggests doing so could be detrimental to Voldemort since he's already made so many Horcruxes. I don't really know what else to add to this, but if I think of more; I might add on. Any thoughts on this idea?

Sorting opinion,"So in high school I was sorted into Gryffindor in the original Pottermore test. After calibrations were made and some balancing things to do with Hufflepuff were changed, I was forced to retake the test upon logging in again. I was then sorted into Hufflepuff. There was about 2 years between these tests and I changed a lot between, but friends say that I'm just in between and 9nce the balances were made, I was actually slightly more Hufflepuff. This was probably 4 or more years ago.

What do you think? 

If this happened to you would you consider yourself Gryffindor or Hufflepuff? Why?

Dean Thomas Yule Ball Question,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Quick question/discussion point here that's been bothering me since a series re-read. Ok so during GOF, Harry ends up asking Parvati to the Yule Ball. Dean mentions that Harry and Ron are lucky because her and her sister are the prettiest girls in their year. But what's confusing to me is that Seamus had already asked Lavender (Parvati's BFF) and it just seems like when Seamus asked Lavender, wouldn't it have made sense for Dean, since he was interested, to ask Parvati? Like, ""Hey, do you two want to go with us two?"" That's literally what Harry did. Did Dean ask her and she said no? Did Seamus muster the courage to do something by himself? Was Parvati holding out for Harry? What do you guys think?",0,"Dean Thomas Yule Ball Question Hi all,

1- Abraxas Malfoy, Draco's grandfather and Lucius' father, was crucial in the ousting of Nobby Leach, wizardkind's first Muggleborn Minister of Magic, from office in 1968. Like daddy, like son, I guess

2- The Sacred 28 was a list of Pureblood family names that began to anonymously circulate sometime in the 1930s-40s, listing the only truly Pureblooded families left in Britain. They were;
_____
Abbott, Avery, Aberystwyth, Black, Bulstrode, Burke, Carrow, Crouch, Fawley, Flint, Gaunt, Greengrass, LeStrange, Longbottom, Macmillan, Malfoy, Nott, Olivander, Parkinson, Prewett
Rosier, Rowle, Selwyn,bShacklebolt, Shafiq, Slughorn, Travers, Weasley, Yaxley
You'll notice the Potters aren't listed. That's because the author of the list suspected the Potters, Potter being a distinctly Muggle name, might not be as pure as was assumed, so decided to leave them off the list.
____'
3- Nicholas Flamel, Dumbledore's alchemist friend from Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone, was a real, live dude. The real Flamel was a 14th century shop owner in Paris, and while he was allegedly rumoured to have dabbled in alchemy, he wasn't accused until centuries later. He probably never even tried to be immortal, boring old guy he was. His house is in Le Marais to this day, you can go there and see all the alchemical secrets he didn't even have ....

Barty Crouch Jr - the mirror of Snape ?,"Barty Crouch Jr, is arguably one of the most interesting and underrated character in the Potterverse.. 

Besides the fact that he managed to overcome legendary auror Madeye Moody and successfully deceive Albus Dumbledore for an entire year, Barty Crouch Jr. possesses incredible magical skills. But the thing that interests me the most is the parallels to Severus Snape.. 

Ever loyal to Lord Voldemort - even after The Dark Lord's downfall - he poses as a double agent, similar to our now favourite Potions Teacher. The difference, of course, is that while Snape is indeed loyal to Dumbledore and the Order, Barty Crouch Jr. - posing as Madeye Moody - is loyal to the dark side. They are in many ways opposites. 

Crouch Jr. was born into a wealthy and powerful wizarding family, growing up with a sense of belonging and a sense of entitlement. Snape was born into a broken home with an abusive alcoholic father. 

Crouch Jr. was incredibly smart and talented, achieving 12 Owls. Snape also showed and incredible aptitude for magic, creating his own spells and curses in his school years. 

Both men showed a fascination for the dark side, and joined the ranks of The Dark Lord in their late school years, eventually becoming two of Lord Voldemort's most trusted lieutenants. 

Snape, however, eventually becomes a double agent - or a double-double agent if you will - working for the Order, while convincing Lord Voldemort that he was indeed doing the opposite. Crouch Jr. on the other hand never change his old ways, and after cheating his way out of Azkaban thanks to his dying mother, and eventually breaking free of his father's Imperius Curse, becomes  a double agent for the opposite side. There are several other parallels in the story, and I could go on forever with this. I just wish to know what you guys think about this train of thought.

I listened to the first 3 books on tape and just watched the movies for the rest. With that said in the new fantastic beast movie that I just finished watching 30 mins ago Dumbledore talkes about how that there is a legend that a Phenix will always come to the aid of someone in his family if they need it. I couldn't help but think when he said that but think about all the times that the Dumbledores Phenix came to help Harry. I know at the end of the movie they show it to hit that what's his name is a decendent of Dumbledore but I feel like that that is just a trick by Grindelwald. I feel that Harry and Dumbledore may be decendents of the same family. I have almost no evidence to back this up but it just seemed weird to me that they would include the line and set up such an obvious fake ending without there being some truth to it aka talking about Harry. Or maybe I'm crazy lol I wanna see what people that actually know alot about this stuff have to say.,0,Harry is related to Dumbledore Ok I want to start off by saying that I am not the biggest Harry Potter fan in the world.

Also, that scene where he is shouting ""HARRY POTTER IS DEAD"" and proceeds to laugh in the trolliest way possible, I couldn't see the rest of the film because of my tears"

The Weasleys shouldn't be poor post-canon?,"Alright so just hear me out. In the first book the Weasleys have Percy, Fred, George, Ron and Ginny living with them. With Arthur at work at a pretty low-level ministry job and Molly a stay at home mom. Makes sense they'd struggle financially with 7 people and one income.

Starting from the second book, Ginny attends Hogwarts. Till now Molly had been busy as a stay at home mother and tutor to the children so didn't have time to work. But now, in theory, she had 10 or so months where she was entirely without charges with the exception of certain holiday periods.

Although she hadn't held a job in at least 20 or so years by this point, if at all, she could've started somewhere still. Despite perhaps lacking job-experience it is established that she is a very capable witch both in the books as by J.K. Rowling.

Let's assume that she can't since their financial situations doesn't seem to improve. Let's move on.

Percy graduates at the end of PoA and starts working at the ministry pretty much straight away. He's still living at home but judging by his character, he would probably at least pay for his own expenses rather than take advantage of his parents.

So now the Weasleys have 4 dependents for only 2 months a year. 

Still no change. Fair enough, 4 kids is still a lot with 1 salary.

By the end of that year, Harry has won the triwizard tournament and donates his winnings to Fred and George to aid in the establishment of their shop. They start making some pocket change while at school but are unlikely to contribute to household expenses.

That year Percy estranges from his family and moves out. Arthur is attacked by Nagini and hospitalised and Fred and George leave Hogwarts to start their own business full-time.

So a pretty rough year for them and it can be assumed that their financial situation didn't have a chance to improve immediately because of Arthur being hospitalised and being unable to work.

However by the end of that year Arthur and Molly only have 2 dependents left (Ginny and Ron) since Percy moved out. Fred and George too are mentioned to have moved out and into their own flat above their jokeshop. Their jokeshop is already lucrative during the summer so they are able to provide for themselves. It's also mentioned that Arthur gets a promotion and has 10(!) people working underneath him.

Yet it is still mentioned quite frequently how poor the Weasleys are... even with only 2 kids living with them during the summer only and an increased income. Of course it could be argued that Hogwarts tuition is very expensive. But with it being the only Wizarding school in Britain and Albus Dumbledore being headmaster for decades, I doubt he'd allow tuition to be expensive.

So by all means at least by this time their financial situation should show some improvement... but it doesn't.

Then of course the 2nd wizarding war really kicks off and the Burrow burns down so it's hard to say what goes on with the Weasleys at that point. Still even in Fanfics the Weasleys are always depicted as poor even when the story takes place after the end of the 2nd wizarding war.

Of course their house burnt down but realistically they only have 1 dependant left in Ginny (Ron canonically never returns to Hogwarts) and Arthur has received a promotion so should be able to provide modest housing for the three(four?) of them and for them to live modest lives without being as poor as they have been in the previous 7 books.",0,"The Weasleys shouldn't be poor post-canon?

Arguing that characters should have ended up with someone else or saying that some couples don't work is kind of preposterous,"As someone who has argued about Harry Potter couples and who should have ended up with who, I now realize that it is rather preposterous. 

Most people argue about why some couples work based on what was in the books, but the thing we see most for the romantic pairings in the series is just a bunch of weird flirting coming from teenagers with undeveloped hormones. I mean,  I'd like to think that the characters grew up and out of their weird and immature habits. 

If we should be judging any of the canon couples from anything it should be from the epilogue, in the epilogue, we see that the kids we knew are now adults. As adults, they now have a control on their old immature habits and have fully developed mentally. 

Seeing as the two most argumentative couples in the series are happily married after 19 years since we lost saw them, who are we to say that they should be with someone else, especially when they are obviously happy with who they ended up with an how life turned out for them?",0,"Arguing that characters should have ended up with someone else or saying that some couples don't work is kind of preposterous As someone who has argued about Harry Potter couples and who should have ended up with who, I now realize that it is rather preposterous.

In defense of Lockhart,"Lockhart is one of my favourite characters in the series and I think it's not fair he gets so much hate from the fandom.

Here are some great things about Lockhart for you to discuss:
- He is an extremely funny, entertaining character to read/watch
- He might not be a great DADA teacher, but it doesn't mean he doesn't teach students anything. His lessons include acting (Harry doing impersonations of some of the characters from Lockhart's stories), he assigns students writing poems as homework, he teaches them literature appreciation by making them read his books. I think a class that lets you use your creativity is very much needed at Hogwarts.
- He further uses his natural creativity organizing a dueling club or Valentine's day celebration. It feels like teachers at Hogwarts in general just do their job and that's it. Lockhart is there for only one year and he already tries to make Hogwarts a cooler and more entertaining place.
- He really cares about his fans. I'm sure he would sell lots of books regardless, but he spends hours and hours of his free time, often late into the night, to reply to letters from fans and readers. He even sends Hermione a ""get well"" card when she is in the hospital wing. How sweet is that?

There you go. I don't deny Lockhart's overconfident and lacks courage, but I think overall he's a pretty cool character.",0,"In defense of Lockhart Lockhart is one of my favourite characters in the series and I think it's not fair he gets so much hate from the fandom.

In Dumbledore‚Äôs notes about The Tale of the Three Brothers he makes the following revelation:

‚ÄúMost witches or wizards prefer a wand that has ‚Äòchosen‚Äô them to any kind of second-hand wand, precisely because the latter is likely to have learned habits from its previous owner that might not be compatible with the nee user‚Äôs style of magic.‚Äù

Since Harry was using Draco‚Äôs old wand during his final duel with Voldemort, the same wand that had beaten Dumbledore when he wielded the Elder wand, I would argue that it gave Harry an additional edge to beating it this time around as compared to a different wand... because it beat it already and learned from that experience.

Today, I went into my credit card account to pay off my statement for the month and saw two separate charges for over $400 each. I went into my Ticketmaster account and see that now I have two different sets of 2 tickets for the same show on the same day, and Ticketmaster won‚Äôt let me return/sell the tickets. 

Has anyone else had a similar problem like this happen, and if so how did you fix it? If I can‚Äôt get it resolved then I will probably charge it back through my credit card company, but I don‚Äôt want to have my other tickets taken away also as I do really want to see this play. 

Tl:DR: Ticketmaster double charged me for CC tickets even though I only received one confirmation and I don‚Äôt know how to get my money back "
Inbreeding of the pure bloods,"I reread the series this past summer and started to think more about why the Slytherin laggies, like Crabbe and Goyle, are all really dim witted. There are many other slytherins that are described this way, and it could possibly be from the inbreeding done to keep their bloodline pure. Just like with Voldemort‚Äôs mother and her side of the family, the few purebloods that were left must have kept inbreeding, resulting in stupid Slytherins. I didn‚Äôt realize this until I got back to the 6th book and read about the Gaunt family, then it clicked why other pure blood families had similar traits.

Nagini Controversy as a Korean,"Let me tell you why Nagini being played by a Korean woman is not a problem:

#1 Her being an Asian woman does not put her in any lesser place. The Dark Lord CLEARLY considers her as a comapnion of some sort. Yes that does not really make it seem ""equal"" but Voldemort always thought of himself higher than anyone around him. And for him to think that she is ""worthy"" enough to carry part of his soul is in his twisted ways, is quite huge. Consider his other horcruxes: Helga Hufflepuff's cup, Salazar Slytherin's lockett, his diary etc. He was always considerate towards her more than anyone he considered to be loyal followers. 

#2 Yes he may never have had ""friends"" in traditional sense due to his homicidal tendancies. He loved gaining power and didn't stop at nothing to achieve more. It's quite sad already to think about Nagini being manipulated for a psychopath's personal gains, but makes a good storyline. 

#3 If people are upset over her being used for Dark Lord's power, why weren't they upset over him using an underage boy, Draco Malfoy, to murder a school principal and let in the school terrorists, the Death Eaters? Where was an uproar for Bellatrix torturing Hermione? This is not about being political correct. This is about picking and chosing the burden of equality when it is convenient for people who have not researched the source material thoroughly enough. 

#4 Nagini seems to be in circus in the old days. Which I am so sure they were sensitive towards her heritage and/or other Asians' (sarcastic tone). And we we have not even watched the movie yet, has Rowling even showed us if this movie was actually gonna be deliverately appropriating either Indian or Korean culture? As a Korean myself, I am just excited for ÏàòÌòÑ(Claudia Kim) to play the character in the Harry Potter universe that will become one of the most frightening villans. Which btw reminds me, yaaaaaaaaaaas.

In conclusion, Rowling is a fantastic writer who keeps on surprising everyone, Nagini having a backstory like it shows in the trailer is exciting, and read the books before complaining like illiterates. #HarryPotter #Nagini #Voldemort #politicallycorrect #JKRowling #Korean",0,"Nagini Controversy as a Korean Let me tell you why Nagini being played by a Korean woman is not a problem:

Why Slytherins are portrayed as they are.,"A point many people complain about concerning the Harry Potter series is the way that House Slytherin and it‚Äôs members are portrayed in books and movies. They mainly are shown to be people with evil intentions and/or a bully attitude. I‚Äôm not talking about all Slytherins (as we know, people like Regulus or Slughorn are examples of Slytherins being different than that) but the generation that goes to school at the same time Harry and his friends are. 

I think the thing many people seem not to take into consideration when complaining about the portrayal of Slytherins is that the generation of Slytherins Harry encounters in school is the generation that was raised by death eaters. 

Look at Draco, a guy who as we learn was massively indoctrinated from a young age on. Same goes for Crabbe and Goyle and others. Of course not all of them were but if you imagine that each year has some people like this it starts to make sense. If many of your friends acted like that and you weren‚Äôt equipped with an incredibly strong moral compass at the age of 11 you would likely go along with it, just to fit in (the competitive house system in Hogwarts that creates an us vs. them feeling doesn‚Äôt help either).


Draco only starts to break out of this world his parents made him be part of when he is asked to kill a man at the age of 16. Nobody else had this kind of experience so they continue to go along with the ways they‚Äôve been taught. Then, during the time of DH the new leadership of the school starts to encourage this behavior. 

So the day comes, where they are given the choice: fight to protect the boy your parents and your friends despise, whose reappearance endangers you and your friends, or the side your parents and friends are at? 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still wrong to help Voldemort but I think all of this explains why Slytherins were displayed so negatively in the books and why no Slytherin stays to fight for Hogwarts. It‚Äôs not because all Slytherins are bad people but because this generation grew up plagued by indoctrination and toxicity and the system they lived in made it really hard to break out of it.

Did Dumbledore Care for Harry,"This question has been bugging me since I re read the series in March ... I want to believe that Dumbledore did care as deeply for Harry as he claimed, but at the same time i don't truly believe that.

Wouldn't you want someone to be as prepared as possible for this sort of fate if you truly cared about them ?

Question about Voldemort and Nagini (Discussion post with potential spoilers),"Ok.  So now that we have the newest trailer for Crimes of Grindelwald, I have a question about Voldemort and Nagini.

&amp;#x200B;

It was always my understanding that the reason, or at least a major reason, that Voldemort overlooked Harry being a horcrux was because nobody ever thought that a human could be one.  Now that we know Nagini was in fact a witch, and therefore a human made into a horcrux by Voldemort... wouldn't Voldemort at least have considered the fact that him and Harry's connection might be due to the fact that Harry was also one of his horcruxes?  I mean... Voldemort isn't stupid, and now because of the trailer he would have clearly been aware that humans can be made into horcruxes since he turned Nagini into one.  It just seems uncharacteristic of Voldemort to not even consider the idea since he was so obsessed with Harry being his downfall, and was obviously intent on discovering what kind of connection they had to one another.  If he had figured it out, Voldemort wouldn't have tried to kill Harry... he would have probably just tried to capture him and lock him away somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I can think of is that perhaps when Nagini and Voldemort first meet, Nagini is already transformed into a snake.  Nagini then never reveals to Voldemort that she is in fact a human animagus, therefore Voldemort assumes that he is creating a horcrux in an animal and not a human.  Nagini would be no different than any other animal in his eyes because he can parseltongue so he just assumes shes a snake, and therefore he would never know that humans could be horcruxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know why Nagini would never reveal to Voldemort that she was a human, since Nagini is his most loyal ally.",0,"Question about Voldemort and Nagini (Discussion post with potential spoilers) Ok.

During this time, link posts are not allowed. All posts should focus on starting discussion about the Potterverse, whether it's fan theories, book/film critiques, headcanon, fan fiction, or anything else!

Hermione's opinion on rules - Does she actually care about them at all?,"I did not originally come up with this idea as I saw someone else mentioning it a few weeks ago but I think it is an interesting one.

The general idea is that while Hermione pretends to care a lot about rules, and students obeying those rules in reality Hermione doesn't actually care at all, and instead uses those rules as a method of controlling other students, for instance when she did not want Harry and Ron to duel Malfoy in the first book she stated it was against the rules and they would get into trouble. Now this is valid, but it can also be looked at another way, so instead of Hermione being concerned about the rule breaking, she was actually much more concerned about Harry or Ron getting hurt, which is a good thing too, and she in that moment used the rules to try and bring Harry and Ron into line, and prevent them from doing something stupid.

The moment that her rules argument did not work Hermione went along with them, breaking the same rules that she had been quoting only moments before, because her original goal wasn't to stop them breaking the rules, but rather to stop them getting hurt, so when the rules did not stop them, Hermione decided to ignore the rules herself.

We see evidence of this littered through the books, where Hermione often uses school rules when arguing with others, the school rules always corresponding with what she wants them to do anyway, but when it comes to something she wants to do then Hermione not only ignores the school rules, but she ignores them in a big way, from setting Snape on fire, creating illegal potions in the girls bathroom, inviting boys into the girls bathroom, striking other students, talking back to teachers, kidnapping, blackmail, convincing students to sign a cursed parchment and probably a lot more than just those.

Now we could say Hermione did all those things for the greater good, but when she quotes rules like they are unbreakable, and then breaks them whenever she feels it necessary does this show a pattern of Hermione not actually caring about the rules at all, and her merely using the rules to try and keep other students in line?

I am very curious to know what people think here.",0,"Hermione's opinion on rules - Does she actually care about them at all? I did not originally come up with this idea as I saw someone else mentioning it a few weeks ago but I think it is an interesting one.

What weird theories did you make due to misreading the books?,"I'm in the middle of a series re-read and am remembering everything I misunderstood as a kid. For example, I completely misunderstood the scene in PoA where Professor McGonagall tells the students Trelawney ""has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school"". I though Trelawney was predicting the death of the *same* student each year. So when waiting for Goblet of Fire to be published I tried to predict who that student was and when they would die.

I also thought the Chamber of Secrets would have multiple secrets, not just one Basilisk. I remember getting mad at Harry for not exploring.

Barty Crouch Jr. was one of the most underutilized characters in the series,"  I reread Goblet of Fire again for the first time in a while and came out frustrated by how Crouch Jr‚Äôs character was treated. There are a lot of interesting things about this guy. He easily tricked Dumbledore in the impersonation of a man he had been close friends with for years. Dumbledore, who easily saw through Gilderoy and Quirrell. Dumbledore had a preexisting, personal relationship with real Moody and still didn‚Äôt see through Crouch Jr‚Äôs facade. That‚Äôs an entire school year of fooling the world‚Äôs most powerful wizard.  

  And while doing so he managed to be arguably the DADA teacher the golden trio ever had. As an aside, this guy had to teach each year DADA and, unless he‚Äôs just popping in a movie for every class but Harry‚Äôs, that's a huge amount of dedication and deception. I mean, he had to make lesson plans for first years. Anyway, he completely won the trust of Harry, Dumbledore, and the student body as a whole. Including Neville, whose parents he helped torture to insanity. Yikes. We see how he directly influence‚Äôs the characters actions to help Harry with the three tasks. This is not just about being a good actor. This guy has some serious Dumbledore level manipulation skills and ridiculously strong magical ability. He overtook real Moody, one of the most revered Aurors in the world after being imprisoned and essentially mind dead for years, and hoodwinked an extremely old, powerful magical object that, as far as we know, had never before been tricked. This guy is *good*.

  So, we all know that JK had to do a big rewrite of GoF. I have to wonder if she decided much later on in the rewrite to make Crouch Jr. impersonate Moody. For one, there‚Äôs practically no distinction between later books real Moody and fake Moody. It‚Äôs mentioned that the two aren‚Äôt the same person, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione treat the two characters practically interchangeably. It‚Äôs actually pretty easy to temporarily forget that GoF Moody wasn‚Äôt the real Moody. And Crouch Jr. himself is largely forgotten for the rest of the series. He‚Äôs never really brought up. Pretty weird for the enormous role he played in the fourth book, being the man most responsible for bringing Voldemort back to life. Of course, he‚Äôs conveniently given the Dementor‚Äôs Kiss at the end, but Harry never reflects on his time with Moody. He was Harry‚Äôs mentor for a full year, as Lupin was. How does Neville feel that the teacher who took him under his wing was one of the people who tortured his parents? That a Death Eater successfully lived at Hogwarts for an entire year? They were all largely affected by this incredibly powerful sociopath who Rowling sweeps under the rug.  

  I mean, what a bummer. Had he lived he could have continued to be such as fascinating, powerful character. A former mentor of Harry‚Äôs on the dark side. Someone with such obvious magical and manipulative skill working against the Order. He had an interesting, sympathetic backstory. His big ministry father never gave him the time of day. He, unlike the other Death Eaters, came from a background that was not already involved in the Dark Arts or raised on the notion of pureblood supremacy.  

  It would have been awesome to experience Crouch Jr. as Crouch Jr., beyond just being a Moody stand in. There‚Äôs no cannon information on what house he was in. Exploring, say, a Ravenclaw turned Death Eater would have been cool and gone against the whole ‚Äúall Death Eaters are all Slytherins and all Slytherins are bad‚Äù theme which I think is one of the weakest parts of the series. There‚Äôs Wormtail, but he‚Äôs not a true supporter, just a coward. Having Crouch Jr. completely eliminated and forgotten feels too easy, and undermines his entire role in the rebirth of Voldemort. Also, think of how awesome a duel to the death would have been between real Moody and Crouch Jr. Think of the insane beef Moody would have had with him after all that went down. They would have been great counterparts, acting as the general of the Order and Death Eaters respectively. Instead, Crouch Jr. gets the Kiss and fades into obscurity, while Moody absorbs Crouch‚Äôs time as fake Moody into his character. Even if he still died, I feel like Crouch Jr. should have been kept more in the psyche of the series. Like I said, bummer.  

**TL;DR**  Barty Crouch Jr. could have evolved into a great character, but ends up a forgettable bump in the HP journey.

The Sword of Gryffindor would have been an indestructible horcrux?,"A goblin blade can only take on that which makes it stronger, so how would you destroy a goblin-made sword? 

I‚Äôm making a big assumption here, but my guess is that goblin-made metals can only be melted down or destroyed by magical (perhaps non-wand) techniques known only to goblins. 


If this is hypothesis is true, then:

A. Only goblins can destroy goblin-made blades.

B. Goblin-made blades will only take on that which makes them stronger.

C. A horcrux can only be destroyed by an exceptionally powerful magical entity that must damage it beyond magical repair.

Observation about the brightness of Mars,"I was listening to OOTP and realized that in Firenze's divination lesson, he teaches the students briefly about Mars. He explains that Mars is the bringer of war and conflict (which makes sense, considering the Roman god Mars). That recalls a certain scene in PS, when Bane and Ronan comment on the brightness of Mars to Hagrid, Harry, and Hermione. According to the centaurs' divination, they were telling Hagrid and co. that war and conflict were rapidly approaching. Which, of course, they were. I thought that was a really cool callback to something that happened 4 years earlier.",0,"Observation about the brightness of Mars I was listening to OOTP and realized that in Firenze's divination lesson, he teaches the students briefly about Mars.

"Little theory on why Crouch Sr calls Percy ""Weatherby"".","Re-reading Goblet of Fire something struck me as odd. In Chapter 28, The Madness of Mr Crouch, we see Barty Sr going back and forth between moments of lucidity and moments of insanity. There, he talks to ""Weatherby"" but immediately afterwards mentions his wife and child, and how Barty Jr got 12 OWLs. 

&gt; ""Thank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup of tea. My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge."" 
&gt; 
&gt; Crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely unaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much he didn't notice that Crouch had released him. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Yes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.S, most satisfactory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo from the Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to draft a response. ..."" 

Now we know (or rather, assume) that Percy is Weatherby because we have seen Crouch call him that in the Quidditch WC, but how could he still be talking to Percy about his wife and child? We know they have been dead for quite some time, and Percy only started working in the Ministry very recently. By the time GoF takes place, it's assumed that Mrs Crouch and Barty Jr have been dead for at least 10 years, maybe more.

My theory is that Weatherby was Mr Crouch's assistant *before* Percy, and when he was replaced Barty simply didn't care to learn a new name (or maybe didn't even realized, if he was under Imperius). I always thought it was kinda lame that Percy's nickname was just a bastardized version of Weasley, this could somewhat explain why he's so adept to keep calling him that (and Percy never correcting him), specially if Weatherby was a very long term assistant and Crouch cared for him.",0,"Little theory on why Crouch Sr calls Percy ""Weatherby"".

What do you think You-Know-Who's final Horcrux was planned to be?,"This question may seem confusing at first, since Voldemort made Nagini his final Horcrux. So, he must have planned for her, right? Well, not really.

According to Dumbledore, Voldemort was reserving his final Horcrux for Harry's death:

&gt;""He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death.""

So, with Harry's death, Voldemort would have split his soul into 7 parts: himself, the diary, the ring, the locket, the cup, the diadem, and ____.

However, of course, he wasn't able to do this technically, since his curse rebounded and destroyed his body when he tried to kill Harry, unknowingly making Harry a Horcrux. He then decided to make Nagini his ""final"" Horcrux later, thinking he would have split his soul into 7, when he in fact split it into 8 because of Harry.

But, Voldemort didn't plan to make Nagini the final Horcrux with Harry's death. He hadn't met Nagini at the time he tried to kill Harry. But, whatever object he was planning to make his Horcrux with was likely with him when he went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry. 

But, such an object wasn't found in the rubble of the Hollow. So, what could it have been?

I'm thinking something from Gryffindor, being that he had the locket from Slytherin, the cup from Hufflepuff, and the diadem from Ravenclaw.

I personally believe from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvFlLer75o) that said object was in fact the Sword of Gryffindor. But, someone pointed out to me that, maybe, Voldemort knew the Potters had the cloak of invisibility, and mistook it for an object from Gryffindor, and was going to take it and make it a Horcrux after he killed Harry.

So, what do you think? Might he have planned to make the sword his final Horcrux? Or maybe the cloak? Or something else entirely?",0,"What do you think You-Know-Who's final Horcrux was planned to be?

I didn't like Tom Riddle's actor in HBP.,"In general, i like Fran Dillane. He's an awesome actor. But as Tom Riddle? no.

&amp;#x200B;

 Tom Riddle was charming. When we see CoS for the first time, no one, not even my mom who is great at picking up negative impressions from people, thought he was bad.¬†

He was actually handsome, he looked innocent, and even the way he spoke did in no way make us think of him as a bad person. And it took until the very end for us to realize his true colors.

Tom Riddle isn‚Äôt creepy. He‚Äôs not supposed to be all dark and menacing outwardly while in school. That shoddy scene in HBP was so poorly done that my mom and I were both horrified by it. Slughorn looked terrified and he shouldn‚Äôt have been because Tom was his charismatic and most favorite student. Tom had the whole school eating out of his palm, sans Dumbles.

Tom‚Äôs group did not outwardly treat people terribly. In HBP, Dumbles explains this to Harry. There were many weird things that happened over those years, but none that could be linked back to Tom or his companions. They were basically golden students.

In the actual memory, Tom put on an act. He stuttered, tripped over his own words, and kissed Slughorn‚Äôs ass until his nose was brown. That is how to properly get information from someone like Slughorn. Instead, the film shows him standing creepily in place the whole time, rubbing his new ring like some poorly scripted villain, and acting suspicious. It was like the director wanted us to know he‚Äôs bad. But if you watched the former movies, you would *know* he was bad. No one else was supposed to know he was bad!

HBP lacked in so many things and it is probably the most disappointing of all the films. Christian Coulson could have played both Toms. With a beard he ages a lot, and without one he still looks the fucking same as he did when playing Tom in CoS!

I have a theory about the personality of Luna Lovegood,"So Luna's mom died when she was nine right?

- What if she had a really close relationship with her mother?
- What if this relationship was so strong that her emotions became too strong?
- The strength of those emotions could have been so strong that they collapsed in on themselves. 
- Luna could have then became emotionally numb and dismissive to all of the bas things that happen to her to the point where they don't bother her anymore.
- Her relationship with her father may have not been as strong before which may explain why her emotional spectrum has become so limited despite her being around her father all the time.

- All I'm saying is that the death of her mother could have transformed her into the person we know from the books.

- Either that or I'm just over thinking this entire thing.

[SPOILERS] Just read this Vice article about Nagini...,"https://www.instagram.com/p/BoXK-QUD1Yk/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=kono5wrip5p8

I myself am an Asian woman, and I think this article is a load of click-bait bull shit. I get how people might view this as some kind of ‚Äúafterthought‚Äù on JKR‚Äôs part, and if it is, do people just expect her to NOT try and diversify her work in the future? I believe JKR when she says that Nagini being a Maledictus is a detail that she has had planned for a long time. 

The article also accuses the film‚Äôs use of an Asian woman to play Nagini of being ‚Äúdeeply offensive‚Äù because it reinforces a stereotype of Asian women being submissive beings. For one, we haven‚Äôt even seen the goddamn movie yet. We‚Äôve seen Nagini in ONE trailer. The movie could go in directions we haven‚Äôt thought of yet. 

Second, I think that JKR, like many, many other writers, creates certain details with the intent of making the audience upset or angry (to a certain degree) enough to question the nature of the situation and how it connects to reality. For example, I took a Harry Potter class during my last semester of college and we spent one day talking a lot about house elves and what family life might be like for them, and life in general outside of their duties. One girl raised her hand and was immediately super triggered because how certain house elves are treated in the books made her really upset, and she had also just looked up ‚Äúhouse elves‚Äù on Pottermore and she was mad that JKR did not include a whole lot of detailed info on them when there are lots of details about other, more insignificant plot points on the site. My response was that it seemed like JKR did this on purpose because it reflects the nature of slavery and how house elves are treated in the wizarding world: they are mostly unseen creatures that take care of everyone‚Äôs problems without most wizards ever giving them a second thought, which is why Hermione feels so strongly about the issue. Writing all parts of a story to be a perfect world doesn‚Äôt do anyone any favors.

All in all, I think that JKR wants her writing to provoke thought OUTSIDE of what is written in the text/shown on screen, which is what many fiction writers do.  I think that she wants people to question certain details because it makes us think about how those details might reflect the real world.

Writing ALL female characters to be incredibly diverse, independent, and powerful individuals that live in a society that does not create boundaries for them is frankly unrealistic and would not provoke any productive conversation.

One girl raised her hand and was immediately super triggered because how certain house elves are treated in the books made her really upset, and she had also just looked up ‚Äúhouse elves‚Äù on Pottermore and she was mad that JKR did not include a whole lot of detailed info on them when there are lots of details about other, more insignificant plot points on the site. My response was that it seemed like JKR did this on purpose because it reflects the nature of slavery and how house elves are treated in the wizarding world: they are mostly unseen creatures that take care of everyone‚Äôs problems without most wizards ever giving them a second thought, which is why Hermione feels so strongly about the issue. Writing all parts of a story to be a perfect world doesn‚Äôt do anyone any favors.

All in all, I think that JKR wants her writing to provoke thought OUTSIDE of what is written in the text/shown on screen, which is what many fiction writers do.  I think that she wants people to question certain details because it makes us think about how those details might reflect the real world.

Writing ALL female characters to be incredibly diverse, independent, and powerful individuals that live in a society that does not create boundaries for them is frankly unrealistic and would not provoke any productive conversation. ",0,"Just read a Vice article about how terribly offensive it is to cast Nagini as an Asian woman... https://www.instagram.com/p/BoXK-QUD1Yk/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=kono5wrip5p8

I myself am an Asian woman, and I think this article is a load of click-bait bull shit. I get how people might view this as some kind of ‚Äúafterthought‚Äù on JKR‚Äôs part, and if it is, do people just expect her to NOT try and diversify her work in the future? I believe JKR when she says that Nagini being a Maledictus is a detail that she has had planned for a long time. 

The article also accuses the film‚Äôs use of an Asian woman to play Nagini of being ‚Äúdeeply offensive‚Äù because it reinforces a stereotype of Asian women being submissive beings. For one, we haven‚Äôt even seen the goddamn movie yet. We‚Äôve seen Nagini in ONE trailer. The movie could go in directions we haven‚Äôt thought of yet.

Did Snape know Pettigrew was the spy?,"I'm re-reading the books for the billionth time and last night at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, I had a thought: how did Snape not already know Pettigrew was the spy and not Sirius? Sirius says that Pettigrew was passing information to Voldemort for a year before James and Lily's death and that other prisoners in Azkaban talk about the one who betrayed them and getting revenge, specifically meaning Pettigrew. So how is it all these other death eaters know Pettigrew is the spy except Snape? I'm assuming that Snape was always within the inner circle, given that he's tasked with overhearing the prophecy so surely he would be involved enough to know that Pettigrew is the one passing information about them afterwards?

In OotP, Dumbledore says the prophecy was made 16 years ago and as Dumbledore is interviewing Trelawney for her job position, we can assume it's probably April/May/June time he's interviewing her or at the very least in the first six months of 1980 going by the fact it's a wet night and most new teachers start from beginning of term. We know Harry is born on 31st of July 1980. A year before James and Lily's death puts us at 31st Oct 1980 so presumably it's around this point Pettigrew betrays them. When Snape begs Dumbledore to hide them, Dumbledore first assumes he's there with a message from Voldemort and Snape agrees to do anything in exchange for hiding them. It's not clear when exactly this meeting occurs, whether it's even before or after Harry is born, but we can still assume it's probably before Pettigrew's betrayal. After the murders, Dumbledore says to Snape that James and Lily placed their faith in the wrong person as Severus did. But if that first meeting with Dumbledore happened before Pettigrew switched sides, how did Snape not figure out for a Full Year that Pettigrew was the spy and tell Dumbledore? Am I missing something huge that explains this or can it be explained simply that Snape just had no idea the spy was Pettigrew but other death eaters did?",0,"Did Snape know Pettigrew was the spy?

Forshadowing- Quirrell,"Right now I am reading TPS to my fiance (his first time with the books) and in Chapter 8, there is a part where Filch is convinced that Harry and Ron were trying to get into the third floor corridor on purpose and that they didn't get lost.

Why did nobody ever point out Voldermort was a half-blood?,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

Why would no one ever point out this dichotomy? ",0,"Why did nobody ever point out Voldermort was a half-blood? I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

Battle of hogwarts tactical mistake,"Okay so during the early stages of the battle before all the death eaters got to the castle lupin takes people up to the towers to launch spells at death eaters. While the main contingent is in the halls and entrances defending. This is really dumb in my opinion. First of all summoning spells, In the wizarding world there are a lot of spells that summon items what I‚Äôm thinking of is the arrow shooting spell. Supporters of the appleby arrows quidditch team used this spell to show their team pride and shoot arrows from their wands it was later banned after almost killing a referee. This tells me three things one: they were real arrows as they almost killed that ref. Two,that the masses could perform the spell meaning it isn‚Äôt that difficult and was at least semi know to people. Three, if you like historically then you may know of arrow storms where soldiers would instead of aiming at each individual soldiers they killed larger amounts of people especially if they were packed together which if the movies are to be believed the death eaters were pretty packed. So they could easily put many more people in the towers to seriously injure or kill death eaters.



Secondly the fighters not at least starting in a formations. Now there wasn‚Äôt much time before the battle to get into position. Instead the fighters were spread throughout the castle, since they were out numbered the defenders would be in duels with two or more death eaters who Probably out skilled  the defenders. If they put a barricade at the entrance and put a large group of fighters behind it they could simply wait for the death eaters to  walk up towards the entrance and then fired spells all at once they could have wiped out whole waves of death eaters at once!

I don't think I'm a Hufflepuff. What do you think ?,"So, I took the Pottermore quiz today, and I got a Hufflepuff. Three times! But I don't think I am. (Nothing against them. Tonks is my favorite female character. She's amazing)
Hufflepuffs are hard-working, patient, calm, and so on...
I'm not hard-working. Actually, I don't like learning. I'm very impatient, and I get angry easily. I'm also reckless and vengeful.
I am adventurous and ambitious. If I was a witch, my ambition would be to become an auror. 
I also don't think that all people are equal. 

I love my friends and family. If they were in danger, I would go to save them or die for them without thinking.
Yes, I value fairness, loyalty, but still I don't think I belong to Hufflepuff. Although, I'm introverted and not really outgoing. But that's because I have no friends (I think).",0,"I don't think I'm a Hufflepuff. What do you think ? So, I took the Pottermore quiz today, and I got a Hufflepuff. Three times!

What's the role of the magical community into the future?,"I'm kind of fascinated about the idea of the future in the Harry Potter world.

Will the two communities stay separate as long as humanity exists? If humans live on other planets will magical people follow?

Will Muggle technology ever rival or surpass magic (think of the incredible replicators, transporters and holodecks from Star Trek)?

Will a sufficiently advanced technology be able to detect magic? Will the magical community make strides in their own domain (newer, better magic) or is there a plateau?

My main question to the community is really the general one in the title, the above text is mostly a stream of thought :) What do you think?",0,"What's the role of the magical community into the future? I'm kind of fascinated about the idea of the future in the Harry Potter world.

#The Mystery

The puzzle was meant to be a scavenger hunt, Clue/Cluedo style game with a bit of an escape room element to it. These were the intended steps to be able to solve the mystery of what happened to Roshia Daenan.

1. Go to Roshia‚Äôs profile page and find [this post](https://redd.it/9c685u). It‚Äôs a large Sudoku puzzle with letters replacing numbers and a string of numbers that will lead you to [this imgur post](https://i.imgur.com/IRD1T4n.png). 
2. Solving the Sudoku and the nonogram together will give you a list of locations, narrowing it down to r/TheRoomofHiddenThings.
3. There is a string of symbols listed on the nonogram that, when run through a gold bug cipher, give you the password to the subreddit: Rowena Ravenclaw, alphabetically or aaaceelnnorrvww.
4. Upon entrance to the private subreddit, now open, there were a multitude of posts and wiki entries to sift through for clues with an intended order.
5. First, find [this post](https://redd.it/9eibw2) in which the first letter of every paragraph spells ‚ÄúQuidditch Pitch‚Äù for the location of the Clue puzzle.
6. Second, find [the corresponding post with an imgur link to a Quidditch pitch](https://redd.it/9efrjo). The title of this post mentions biographies on Wikipedia, aka [the reddit wiki where page where the contestants in the lip sync competition each had a bio](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRoomofHiddenThings/wiki/bios) created.
7. In the above imgur post was also [a comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheRoomofHiddenThings/comments/9efrjo/new_book_on_biographies_mimics_wikipedia_those/e66bzrf/) listing made up book titles having to do with dukes, ducks, fraternities, and searching for hidden meanings. This was your clue to go to theDUQofFRAT‚Äôs bio specifically as he was the culprit that we randomly generated from the contestants.
8. Once at duq‚Äôs bio, there was another clue hidden [in this post](https://redd.it/9eg0p5) leading [to a different wiki page about Morse Code](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRoomofHiddenThings/wiki/bios/morsecode). Being another wiki page was the clue that you had to use Morse Code within the wiki bios for your next clue. Running Morse code on duq‚Äôs bio (though someone in Slytherin pointed out a possible error) should give you the words ‚ÄúThe Sword of Gryffindor‚Äù. This was now the weapon for the Clue game. We also intended for people to find the sword hidden in the header, as all weapons are somewhere in it, but we never made that as clear as we should have.
9. When submitting the google form, found hidden in [this post](https://redd.it/9efozg), the part to submit asked for a password to leave the sub. This password could be found in [this post](https://redd.it/9eexhg). It is a book cipher that should take you the the US Hardcover edition of Deathly Hallows. Each number set should lead you to [this imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/WpVwO5I). It‚Äôs a matchstick puzzle for the password to leave, ‚ÄúAlbus Dumbledore‚Äù.

I hope this explanation helps to all of those that were confused. I realize, given the amount of hints, that we may have been over ambitious in making our puzzles hard to solve but I hope everyone had fun with them.

In this section, 15 points were given for each step - finding the subreddit r/TheRoomofHiddenThings, finding the password to it, and getting each the location, culprit, and weapon for Clue. 

Gryffindor found the subreddit, receiving **15 points**.

Hufflepuff found the subreddit, password, culprit, and weapon, receiving **60 points**.

Slytherin found the subreddit, password, location, culprit, and weapon receiving **75 points**.

Slytherin also found each portion of the puzzle first, for 15 points each and a total of an additional **75 points**.

Wow... did Harry Potter try to outright kill Malfoy in the first movie?,"So I'm watching Sorcerer's Stone... and I think I just watched Harry Potter almost kill Draco during the remembrall scene.

In essence they're 100 feet in the air, and Harry says ""Give it to me Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom.""

Then Harry dives at Draco to do just that. It was only Malfoy's skill with a broom to maneuver out of the way that kept him from plummeting 100 feet to the ground below. 

So... yeah... pretty much almost had 11 year old homicide with no teachers around to help. :-P

Harry Potter care package Exchange,"So, I wanted to share with you a package I just received a few days ago.  
Story behind this is, that I meet one of my friends through a stream and now we ended up sending each other care packages on regular bases, which are based on a theme that we are going to decide beforehand.  
This time the packages are themed all around the magic Universe we both adore so much.

I just love it!

[https://imgur.com/a/sUW6z9m](https://imgur.com/a/sUW6z9m)  


Now I got Harry and Hedwig watching over me at my desk, and a personal apology from Percy himself that my package has been delayed.  
Plus that really cute hidden letter from Arthur to Molly. Poor Molly, never got it though.

Story behind this is, that I meet one of my friends through a stream and now we ended up sending each other care packages on regular bases, which are based on a theme that we are going to decide beforehand.  
This time the packages are themed all around the magic Universe we both adore so much.

I just love it!

The only two parselmouths at Hogwarts since Slytherin himself?,"What about older members of the Slytherin line, or the Gaunt clan? I think it's safe to assume that Marvolo Gaunt did not let Morfin or Merope to attend Hogwarts. You can probably safely assume that Marvolo didn't attend Hogwarts himself. But what about further back on the Gaunt line? Surely they were all parselmouths, and at least some of them, if not all, attended Hogwarts? I mean, they are Slytherin's descendents so why not?",0,"The only two parselmouths at Hogwarts since Slytherin himself? What about older members of the Slytherin line, or the Gaunt clan?

Could Celestina be Singing About Merope Gaunt?,"So I am rereading HBP and I am at the part where Harry is at the Burrow listening to Celestina Warbeck sing on the radio. Considering that JKR rarely writes anything by coincidence, I found it odd that she included some of the verses Celestina sings. I then decided to look at these closely. The three verses she sings are:

Oh, come and stir my couldron,
And if you do it right.
I‚Äôll boil you up some hot strong love
To keep you warm at night. 

Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone?
It‚Äôs left me for a spell...

... and now you‚Äôve torn it quite apart
I‚Äôll thank you to give back my heart

So she‚Äôs obviously singing about a girl who gives a boy some love potion, but their relationship obviously ended badly, just like how Merope gave Tom Riddle Sr the love potion and, once she stopped, he left her. I think that the use of the word spell in the second verse is kind of curious, possibly alluding to the fact that Merope never used magic after Tom Riddle left her? Obviously the taking of her heart both means the heartbreak from the love but also her heart stopping because she died after giving birth to his son. 

I am probably grasping at straws here, but considering that JKR is a brilliant writer I thought I‚Äôd post it here to have a discussion about what you all think!",0,"Could Celestina be Singing About Merope Gaunt?

I think we sort too soon...,"I‚Äôve always had a theory that most children sort into Gryffindor due to their nature; most children are brave almost to foolhardiness, lack too much self-consciousness, and are pretty bad at seeing the shades of gray in the black and white of right and wrong.

How should a wizard's duel actually look part deux.,"A year ago I went a little diatribe on how much I hated the unimaginative use of magic in dueling and fighting in the Harry Potter movies.

https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/73d2o6/the_one_thing_i_hate_most_about_all_of_the_harry/?st=jmp0df4j&amp;sh=f882c0f7

A lot of people in that thread wanted me to describe what I thought a wizard duel should look like.  A lot of them seemed to think I was referring the the look of the spells they were using but I was actually referring to the lack of imagination in terms of what spells they were using.  

Example: [magical friggin laser beams](https://imgur.com/TUWGX0C)

Try as I might I couldn't really provide too many examples of what a real wizard duel should look like except for the [battle between Bavmorda and Fin Raziel at the end of Willow.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW5IIoX19cM)

But now, thanks to Marvel, I have another perfect example.  [The Duel between Thanos and Doctor Strange.](https://youtu.be/mM5qUzi3yio?t=1m38s)  That is **exactly** what a wizard's duel should look like.  Not just firing spells at each other like magic guns or lasers, but really doing shit with magic.

Thoughts about a real life Hogwarts,"Hey guys,

so some months ago I visited the Warner Brother Studios again and when I entered the room with the miniature Hogwarts I started to think about if it would be possible to build a real life Hogwarts (Not every centimeter would be exact like the book- and/or movieversion) but so much as possible. So the Castle could be museum, hotel and for some weekends/weeks a Larp-Adventure at the same Time.

I know that this ‚ÄûProject‚Äú is really a thoughtfully construct and I dont think, that someone could get that amount of money (but I think that many Fans would give money for that Project - like through Kickstarter, but I really dont think, that this Money would be enough)and it would take years.

[Discussion] I‚Äôm starting to really hate Jacob Kowalski as a character...,"Plus Dan Fogler as well. He‚Äôs just way too slapstick and broadly comedic, he absolutely punctures ANY tension in any scene that he‚Äôs in.

Also, in EVERY FUCKING TRAILER that‚Äôs been released for this franchise, they give him his own stupid fucking comic snippet in the middle of at the end of the trailer. Like, I‚Äôm sorry, it doesn‚Äôt work. 

Additionally, the only ones who seem to like him are people with no investment in the story. Let‚Äôs be honest: he‚Äôs Jar Jar Binks. He has no role in the story but to serve as the receiver of exposition dumps, to gawk stupidly at magic ten times throughout the movie, and to scream and flail around at everything as he tangles with some embarrassingly cartoonish cgi creature or effect. 

Like, really, what important role has he played? He hasn‚Äôt played any. He‚Äôs just so tonally jarring and ridiculous, when all the other characters and actors are otherwise serious actors, who‚Äôs humor is of the more natural, mature, Rowlingian variety. 

And the amount of times I‚Äôve heard people say ‚ÄúJacob‚Äôs cool because he reacts to magic‚Äù...really? Running around and gawking at CGI and shit you know isn‚Äôt real is what you want instead of a fleshed our character in a multifaceted story?

A confession,My computer password has forever been Alohomora :3,0,A confession My computer password has forever been Alohomora :3
Fantastic Beasts and Harry Potter,"Was watching the Fantastic Beasts trailer on YT and just scrolled down to read the comments, only to find that there were comparisons being made between Newt and Harry. People were straight up saying that Newt was a far better hero than Harry and would have saved the wizarding world earlier and all. This also reminds me of all those similar articles about how Hermione could have done a better job and single handedly saved the wizarding world had she been the Chosen One. 

Sighs. 

This breaks my heart for Harry who is constantly bashed for no reason other than being a child who acted his age and did the best he can with what he had. Harry was a teenager child people! He was maimed by Voldemort since childhood, imagine living like that! He had to undergo a loveless childhood, a bullying cousin, fatal attacks every year just to be told in sixth year that the Prophecy which Voldemort had listened to need not have been fulfilled if Voldemort hadn't given importance to it in the first place. Dumbledore told Harry that he could walk away, but that time (and this is a very character defining movement) Harry chose to fight not becaue he was the Chosen One or the Boy Who Lived but because he wanted to finish it and finish Voldemort. Its a very powerful scene in Half Blood Prince and in my opinion the reason why Harry was the Hero and will continue to be so. Because he took the reins when the reins needed taking. He may not have been a natural genius or the cleverest wizard of his age or have a mad scientist like affinity for magical creatures, but his greatest quality and his best one was his ability to love and love so strongly that to save  the lives of others this brave seventeen year old boy walked towards his own death alone, during the final battle. That requires immense courage, the same courage that he displayed as a twelve year old when he pulled the sword out of the hat, the same courage with which he fought back the Priori Incatatem to make Voldemort's wand reverse his spells alone in a graveyard full of Death Eaters.

I suggest you all read the Goblet of Fire and Half Blood Prince again and specifically read about those two incidents where Harry proves why he is the hero and deserves every praise ever given to him.

Stop comparing him with Newt or Hermione or whichever other character you think could have done a better job from the books.

Harry is a great man who saved the world when it needed saving. Stop disrespecting him or the others who were all brave in their own regard by comparing them and pitting them against each other.

Sorry got a bit emotional with this post. But I fear those who will see Harry Potter in the light of Fantastic Beasts will make these comparisons and will reduce Harry to just someone who got through by luck. Many of these won't have read the books and since the movies do a great disservice to anyone who is not Hermione will never understand the true Harry Potter; the man who lived.

Thoughts/Questions after re-read of HP and the Sorcerer's Stone,"It's been a while since I read the series and yesterday I sat down with my old copy of Sorcerer's Stone and listened to Stephen Frys wonderful voice. Here are a couple of things that I noticed: 

1. Could it be that Harry didn't know his parents names until he went to Hogwarts? The Dursleys never talked about them, he was not allowed to ask questions and Petunia mostly claimed she never had a sister. 
2. Why is Snape limping and still hurt the day(s) after he tried to get past Fluffy? Even if he didn't dare to go do Madam Pomfrey we know from later (when he tried healing Dracos wounds) that he is quite capable to heal wounds himself. 
3.  The day before the first ever Quidditch match Harry sits outside with Ron and Hermione reading Quidditch through the Ages. Snape sees them, claims that library books are not to be taken outside, confiscates the book and subtracts 5 points from Gryffindor. Wasn't this Hermiones privately owned book? She mentioned in the beginning that she learned all the books on the curriculum by heart plus some general background reading including Quidditch through the Ages. That means she bought that book in Diagon Alley and brought it to Hogwarts. 
4. Why are Quidditch points counted towards the house points? This would make separate Quidditch and House Cups unnecessary. Is this still the case later in the series? It is mentioned that Harry, Hermione and Neville lost all the points Harry gained from Quidditch when they got caught after delivering Norbert. 
5. Is Voldemort now forever cursed because he drank the unicorn blood? Or was it Quirrell that was cursed? Do you have any examples how this showed later?

"New Harry Potter game for PS4/XboxOne/PC like Spider-Man, Batman Arkham, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor/War games","Hey Reddit! So I've been reading the books again..I'm on Goblet of Fire, just around the second task.. and I've been playing alot of Spider-Man lately on PS4. I couldn't help but imagine up what a new gen Harry Potter game would be like if done correctly. 

The games that came out during the time of the movies by EA were kinda...lackluster. 

I want to hear your guys' thoughts on a what a new AAA development epic Harry Potter should be like if made today. I'd like to hear all sorts of ideas!

My own idea is inspired by Spider-Man on PS4 that's recently making headlines:


So I imagine an open world Wizarding World of Harry Potter game. The main ""map"" would be the Hogwarts area of course. The castle, surrounding grounds, Forbidden Forest and The Black Lake would all be part of the normal loaded map. London, The Ministry of Magic, Hogsmeade, Surrey (Little Whinging), Godric's Hallow, Diagon Alley would all be part of an ""instanced"" separate load or be featured in cut-scenes as appropriate depending on the gameplay/story. 

Basic gameplay is a third person action-adventure. Walking/Sprinting is the main trasversal mechanic and broom flight is allow for quick travel when not restricted by story/missions. Apart from the main story, done much like Spider-Man, Batman Arkham games, Shadow of Mordor/War (Middle Earth games), side quests and collectibles are available via NPC students and teachers spread around Hogwarts. ""Please Harry, I cant find my wand, I lost it either in the library or maybe I left it by the banks on the Black Lake..can you help me find it?"". You travel around places using Revelio wand spells to locate it, chat up with students to find out if they've seen a wand lying around, discover Nargils hid it...""battle"" a few and recover. Return it to Neville (example lol) and gain crafting tokens...with which u can learn new spells (selectable via a Spell Wheel mapped to L1), craft better gear (robes/outfits, wands, brooms, etc) Each level grants you skill points, which you can use to purchase skills (double cast spell, double block, redirect enemy spells, dodge, defensive apparate, all done via a combo system). As you level up too, u gain increased health and mana capacity (these can also be made into skills instead if the developers want), flight speed, walk/sprint speed, time-turner use (like a rewind mechanic to fix mistakes you might make occasionally). You can unlock and upgrade the Marauder's Map to show/reveal more things and be more helpful. 

Combat is wand based with animations for occasional close combat melee attacks when appropriate but mostly wand based say using Square/(X on Xbox). Square or R1 fires a simple Stupefy, but bring up the Spell Wheel and select Expeliarmus and u got 1 shot of it (can be upgraded to 3 or 5 like Impact Web in Spider-man) (use L2 for precise aiming). Landing good shots builds up a Mana meter to unleash powerful attacks (hold square) and instant takedowns (press O + Triangle) which also can be upgraded in the Skills tab. Circle would be a roll or dodge depending on combat state (slows down reaction time if timed perfectly once upgraded), triangle would be deflect/block or redirect if timed perfectly and upgraded (later skill upgrades allow you to increase to time to hit a perfect block and even later upgrade will allow you to redirect enemy spell back for instant takedown). There can be instant takedown variations (eg: O + Triangle does a crazy knockback Expeliarmus, O+X does Petrificus Totalus, X+Square does Reducto, aaaannnddd...) there can even be a morality mechanic in the game...depending on whether you choose to do heroic actions or evil actions you go down the path of Phoenix Order Member or Dark Wizard path, which will unlock different spells/skills (for example the light path will allow you to get the Petrificus Totalus instant takedown via O+X but going down the dark path will net you the Cruciatus takedown for O+X..muhahaha.) Other ideas for takedowns can be like for Order of the Phoenix path you can get Fawkes to come down knock out the enemy and put up a wall of flames between you and the Death Eaters; while Dark Wizard path you can get Dark Mark which rains down the wrath of a dark green Nagini-esque snake cloud/smoke attack that deals AoE/DoT effects. You can get levels of the path you're on too; like you can go up to Legendary Wizard on the Order of the Phoenix path and Infamous Wizard on the Dark Wizard path, resulting in availability of more power robes, wands, the spells and skills appropriate to how far down whichever tree you are following!


The game will be grand in scale and epic in presentation. I'm talking realistic movie-inspired art design and true to life setting. The music if taken from the WB films would make it phenomenal...get the cast back from movies to do VO and likeness or get sound alikes. We can delve deep into the mythos and history. 

The story missions will follow the books in chronological order. Opening cutscene Voldemort kills Potters (or better YOU play as Voldemort or James/Lilly), Harry goes to Dursleys, the zoo, Hagrid shows up. First level is instanced playthrough of Harry going to Diagon Alley to go to Gringotts and Olivanders to get school supplies. This is the tutorial. Then Platform 9 3/4. Cutscene on Hogwarts Express. Then you are given control as you get off the train and board the boats to enter Hogwarts. You get sorted. Go to classes (more mini tutorials like spell casting, flight controls, quidditch - HELL YES - EA can use their Fifa Be A Pro skills to bring this to life FINALLY!) The wizarding world isnt short of enemy types either so the game wouldnt get boring fast by any measure: magical creatures, death eaters, DEMENTOR DEMENTOR! Inferi, Slytherins lol, Voldemort himself, big fight against Nagini, all the investigative missions you can have part of the story and side quests too, imagine the lore that can be filled in this game! 

Story missions and timeline-appropriate sidequests take place during Year 1 (Act 1) until you finish Year 1. Trophy/Achievement unlocked! Year 2...cutscene with Dobby at Privet Drive (or instanced gameplay) then back to Hogwarts (I figure the car flight to Hogwarts Express as an open world mission might be a bit much to do in such an already packed game so a cutscene is fine). Basically you keep playing through the years til you get to Year 7 with each section of the story that doesnt take place at Hogwarts be instanced like many missions in Spider-Man/Arkham are. Omg I'm getting so excited just thinking of the possiblity! The Chamber of Secrets, Quidditch House Cup, the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Battle at the Ministry, Battle for Hogwarts! Easily 100+ hours! Take that Witcher III! Now I'm sure but the rights sit with WB, but for gaming etc does EA still have the license? Cuz if not then Monolith, Rocksteady, or anyone can take up the task. If its EA then EA would have to deal with it and I'm not too sure who would be a good fit. I think Visceral Games is dissolved? I dont want DICE touching this no offense. Maybe BIOWARE could kick ass but they're busy with Anthem. 


What ideas do you guys have, what are your thoughts on mine? 

Love and respect to you all let's try to keep this thread alive maybe it'll catch WBIE's eyes! Does anyone know somebody active on Reddit from them who might be able to take a look at this!?

A rhetorical interpretation of the story of deathly hallows,"&amp;#x200B;

The legend of the three brothers gives us an impression that only the cloak is a good thing. Then I realized the wand and the stone were not used properly in the story. What if all the three of them actually work in some way? So here is my understanding of the metaphor of the three deathly hollows:

* The elder wand. Strength. As the possessor of it, one need to be capable of attacking, and always be prepared for defending. Use it but do not get obsessed.¬†
* The resurrection stone. Mind. For it to function in the right way, one need to understand not to dwell on the past. Feel connected with the past but also be able to let go.
* The invisible cloak. Wisdom. Stay low key when necessary, avoid direct confrontation, solve problems in more cunning ways.

Mastering the three hallows requires three different kind of qualities, together they lead to a successful life. Life is against death. The so-called master of death could be more about the spirit than the thing.

Just something suddenly popped into my head, sharing it in case someone may find it interesting :)

THEORY/Headcanon: Tom Riddle was gay,"Tom Riddle Senior I mean (1905-1943)

As much as I dislike fan theories, I had a very unusual thought out of the blue about Voldemort's father and I came to the conclusion that he was a gay man. As random as this may sound, let me explain: 

&amp;#x200B;

We know from the books that he was a very handsome and wealthy man with a large estate, yet he never married or had children (other than Voldemort via rape) by the time he was 38. He instead lived with his parents which I found odd because it was the 1940s. 

It's possible he served in the war and fell in love with a soldier or that he even had an affair with his younger gardener Frank Bryce who also lived alone all his life and stayed loyal to the Riddle estate, looking after it decades after their murders. I also assume his parents disapproved of Tom's ""lifestyle"" but didn't pressure him into marrying a woman and allowed him to keep living in the family manor.

"If you conjured a patronus while polyjuiced, would you produce your original patronus, or the patronus of the person you've polyjuiced into?","I would think you would produce your own, original patronus, which would essentially be a giveaway that you're polyjuiced.

A question about the Imperius Curse,"Does the caster have to be constantly monitoring the victim, or constantly giving commands? Everything it says in the books regarding this curse seems to indicate that the victim can only act upon explicit command, and basically one command at a time. However, we see instances where someone is placed under the curse, and is just given ""general instructions"" on what to do, and they're more or less carrying out their own actions, but under those ""general instructions"". When Mr. Crouch is placed under the curse, he's basically told to send Percy messages to ""do stuff as you normally would do things"", or something like that. As for the notes themselves though, Voldy/Junior/Wormtail (I'm not sure which one of them actually had the curse on him) did not tell me the exact words to put on the notes, Crouch just seemd to be writing the notes himself, under ""general instruction"" to just give Percy instructions as if everything was normal.

Then later, when Pius Thicknesse is [put under the curse by Yaxley, it doesn't seem like Yaxley is commanding his every move, either. Pius walks around and talks to people, without Yaxley there to send commands into his brain like ""say this, do that, write these words on this parchment"", etc. Thuckness is saying, doing, and writing things simply under ""genereal instructions"" from Yaxley to say do and write things in alignment with the death eaters.

To me, this seems to present a flaw in the imperius curse. I don't see how it can be controlled if the caster simply gives a command to ""do things in accordance with X and nothing else"". Because really, whatever is in accordance with X is up to the interpretation of the victim. What if Crouch had written a message to Percy that Voldy/Junior/Wormtail didn't really want him to write, because the interpretation was wrong? What if Thickness had said something to someone that Yaxley wouldn't necessarily approve of, because interpretation of the instruction was wrong? How is being Imperiused like this, yet being SOMEWHAT left to your own devices, foolproof in any way? 

It also raises the question of HOW they can actually interpret general instruction in this way, if Imperius removes free will entirely. If free will is removed entirely, wouldn't it be like, they act on one command at a time, and do nothing and await the next command, and the caster needs to give them explicit command to do anything? If they are able to interpret general instruction and basically do individual actions without the caster knowing, isn't that a form of free will? Because we known that Crouch did not get commanded every single word he wrote to Percy. And for sure we know that Yaxley did not explicitly instruct every word Thicknesse said to e every single person at all times, because that would've been impossible.

And what if boys have some tool/spell that could allow them to peep? I've always wondered. What do you all think?"

Further musings on Credence Barebone's name,"A [fan theory from last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5g7uli/how_credence_barebones_name_gives_away_his/) mentions that Barebone is a synonym of Gaunt, and ""Credence"" is defined as ""belief in or acceptance of something as true"".

From JKR's articles on [Seventeenth Century and Beyond](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/seventeenth-century-and-beyond-en), [MACUSA](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/macusa), and [Rappaport's Law](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/rappaports-law-en), we know that:

1. Scourers turned in other Wizards to magic-hating No-maj's for gold
2. MACUSA's initial mandate was to put Scourers behind bars
3. Scourers disappeared by changing their names and marrying no-maj's
4. Scourers told their descendants that magic is real, magic is evil, people who practice magic should be persecuted and/or killed
5. The Barebones are one of the most prominent Scourer families in America

In addition:

1. The Fantastic Beasts movie shows us that in 1920's America, Mary Barebone is an active Scourer who inculcates hatred of magic in the orphans who are under her care.
2. Mary is Credence's *adoptive* mother, and she names him for ""belief in or acceptance of something as true"" because (educated guess) she wants the world to believe that magic is real and evil.
3. Credence is also black-haired and shares many features with Tom Marvolo Riddle.
4. Credence is a teenager in Fantastic Beasts, which was set in 1926 (Voldemort was born on December 31st, 1926).
5. [This poster of The Crimes of Grindelwald](https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/11/Fantastic-Beasts-2-920x584.jpg) show Claudia Kim (Nagini) in a pose that's reminiscent of the Bellatrix-Voldemort dynamic, and it could be JKR's way of telling us that Nagini worked with/for Credence before she became Voldemort's pet. Perhaps Tom Marvolo Riddle started corresponding with Credence when Tom was a teenager.
6. Grindelwald was defeated in 1945, and Voldemort graduates from Hogwarts around the same time given his age (he would've turned 11 a little too late to join Hogwarts in 1937). Credence and his Obscurus are presumably destroyed at or before this time as well.

So the link between Credence and Gaunt/Slytherin is pretty clear. However, is the link between Barebone and Gaunt clear? While the two words are synonyms, can anyone imagine a Slytherin:

1. Disappearing into Muggle/No-maj society?
2. Marrying (gasp) muggles/No-maj's?
3. Telling their descendants that magic is evil and must be stopped?

I understand JKR has stated on multiple occasions that Slytherin had good and evil in equal measure, and this [Pottermore story on Ilvermorny](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny) shows us that for every Gormlaith and Voldemort, there is also an Isolt and Rionach. But a Slytherin descendant who became a Scourer doesn't strike me as a good person. And an evil Slytherin who isn't a pure-blood fanatic doesn't seem consistent with Pottermore's internal logic.

Harry never killed anyone. Will Newt?,"One thing that I've always loved about Queen Jo is how she managed to write seven epic fantasy novels without having her hero kill another person in the entire series. He destroyed Hocruxes, but the final killing blow was administered by Voldemort himself. Thankfully his trend didn't break in the Cursed Child. Unlike in so many fantasies and bloody thrillers, the hero truly was the opposite of the villain. Murder rips the soul apart both in the world of Harry Potter and in ours, and Harry emerges with his soul intact. 

Do you suppose not killing other people is something Rowling will bring to the Fantastic Beasts series, too? I think (and kinda hope) that she will. None of our four protagonists killed anyone in the first film, and we know Grindy doesn't die in this series, and neither does Nagini. (Though she may not be evil at this point.) I don't think he would kill Credence.

Goblins could have had a hand in vanquishing Voldemort and shared responsibility for the time of peace that it brought.

The inspiration of horcruxes - the power of a death?,"I've noticed a certain power that death has.. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance- the holocaust. It transfixes many people, so many people died so seemingly effortlessly by the truckload. However their death holds power over all of us. The holocaust is one of the most studied aspects of WWII and has influenced so many of our nightmares and dreams and themes in our culture of hell and death and pain and suffering. But it transfixes and fascinates us - for even the most jaded of us we can watch holocaust films in horror and fascination - there is so much subject matter it can sustain us. Many people have spent their lives studying it. Its as though the deaths of these people still can be a source of life for people living today - people who aren't stimulated by our current world get satisfaction out of studying this amazing and gruesome past. 

&amp;#x200B;

What does this remind you of - Horcruxes! The death of a person is not just a death. A soul cannot disappear without its ""power"" being transferred into some other. Perhaps the souls of 6 million victims haven't disappeared but are still a power that people today tap into - to fascinate us and empower us with life. But it is a true, pure life? To live in the past like this - especially transfixed by such horror? Maybe not.

The problem with the Sorcerer's Stone,"This always bugged me in the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone. Literally everyone Harry, Ron, and Hermione talk to about the stone says it is super well protected, and they shouldn't worry about anyone stealing it because of these protections.

Now, lets look at the ""protections"" that well-educated-in-magic teachers have put around potentially the most dangerous artifact in Hogwarts, if in the wrong hands:

* A big three headed dog that goes to sleep the second music is played.

This is probably one of the better protections, other than the fact literally every teacher knows about Fluffy's weakness, and, obviously, there isn't very good background checks on teachers, being that one of them had a dark wizard of the back of his head. Also, a group of first years can trick the gamekeeper, who brought this dog to Hogwarts in the first place, and should be best at keeping its weakness a secret, into blatantly telling them Fluffy goes to sleep by music.

And that wasn't even talking about the trapdoor that wasn't even *locked* by any magic (if it actually was, a first year could still get by it by saying a simple spell they are taught their first year). It's like they wanted someone to pass this protection.

* Professor Sprout's Devil's Snare

This one might be a good protection, if not for the fact that it is easily defeated by one spell first years are taught (if they listen, as Hermione did). So, already two protections are not only passable, but easily passable. Onto the next one:

* Professor Flitwick's Flying Keys

This should be good. How can someone guess out of hundreds of flying keys which one fits into a lock, and then get said key? Well, luckily for you, there are *brooms* provided to catch the keys, and a first year can see which key most likely fits into the lock by its look and color!

* Professor McGonagall's Wizard's Chess

Wow, a game of chess a first year knows how to win almost every time he plays it! But, it's harder, because it is larger! Actually, it's not. At least this protection managed to take out one of the first years... still couldn't take out one teacher who didn't even make the protection, though.

* Professor Quirrell's Mountain Troll

This one would have made sense to be there, if some first years didn't manage to knock one unconscious early in the year. You would think the teachers might have thought about replacing it with another beast that was harder to beat after this? Nope. I guess it makes a little sense, being that Quirrell might have wanted something easy to beat so he could get to the stone quicker, but still. The other teachers should have got a clue to the fact one of their protections is too easy after three (technically two) *first years* beat one by levitating its club and knocking it out.

* Professor Snape's Potion Riddle

This one was explained away by Hermione as being hard for most wizards because they only knew magic, not logic. But come on. I don't care that the first year was very smart. A *first year* beat a ""hard"" riddle made by a professional teacher. Why make the riddle just hard? Why not ""0.000000000000001% pass this"" hard?

And finally:

*Professor Dumbledore's Mirror of Erised.

This one seems dumb and smart at the same time. It seems smart in that, while it shows you the stone if that's what you desire, you will only get the stone if you didn't want to use it. It's also dumb that way. Did Dumbledore not consider the fact that a student who didn't want to use the stone but wanted to stop someone from getting it might pass all these tests? The tests seem easy enough for first years to pass them, so Dumbledore literally was dumb in this moment for thinking this up. Did Hagrid not tell him at any point during the year that Harry had found out about the stone? Would Dumbledore not be worried that his mirror thing might actually give Voldemort the stone if Harry went down there? And you give Harry points for this! What a way to cover up your stupidity and look nice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, I know you might be saying, ""Oh! But, these events had to be passable by first years to progress the plot!""

I know that, and it makes sense for the book as a whole, but not for the characters within. You'd think McGonagall, or Sprout, or Flitwick, or Snape, or heck, even Quirrell of all people, would have tried protections that, I don't know, a first year can't get around, if they were smart teachers?  

I mean, McGonagall! You are a wise witch, yet you make your protection a game of chess? Quirrell, you don't want anyone interfering with your plans to get the stone, yet you make your protection the same species of Troll that first years have been proven to be able to defeat, with *no training*? Come on!

And Dumbledore! You decide to protect this stone with tons of protections, only to decide later to destroy it? Why didn't you destroy it *in the first place*?!? You were able to talk Flamel into destroying it at the end of the year! Surely if you decided the stone must be protected at the beginning of the year, that you could talk to him earlier about destroying it instead of going through the trouble of ""protecting it""?

Why make these protections passable by everyone in the first place? Why wouldn't you lock that trapdoor under the dog with magic that repels alohamora? Why don't you make it so none of the flying keys fit into the door, and make it so only Flitwick knows how to open it? Why provide brooms for that one anyways? Why not just make the teacher for every protection be the only one that knows how to get passed it?

I mean, really. This just really bugged me. I know it was supposed to be easier than challenges later on, because of how the series is supposed to progress, but, in the real world, these teachers should have been way smarter.

I guess it makes a little sense, being that Quirrell might have wanted something easy to beat so he could get to the stone quicker, but still. The other teachers should have got a clue to the fact one of their protections is too easy after three (technically two) *first years* beat one by levitating its club and knocking it out.

* Professor Snape's Potion Riddle

This one was explained away by Hermione as being hard for most wizards because they only knew magic, not logic. But come on. I don't care that the first year was very smart. A *first year* beat a ""hard"" riddle made by a professional teacher. Why make the riddle just hard? Why not ""0.000000000000001% pass this"" hard?

And finally:

*Professor Dumbledore's Mirror of Erised.

This one seems dumb and smart at the same time. It seems smart in that, while it shows you the stone if that's what you desire, you will only get the stone if you didn't want to use it. It's also dumb that way. Did Dumbledore not consider the fact that a student who didn't want to use the stone but wanted to stop someone from getting it might pass all these tests? The tests seem easy enough for first years to pass them, so Dumbledore literally was dumb in this moment for thinking this up. Did Hagrid not tell him at any point during the year that Harry had found out about the stone? Would Dumbledore not be worried that his mirror thing might actually give Voldemort the stone if Harry went down there? And you give Harry points for this! What a way to cover up your stupidity and look nice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, I know you might be saying, ""Oh! But, these events had to be passable by first years to progress the plot!""

I know that, and it makes sense for the book as a whole, but not for the characters within. You'd think McGonagall, or Sprout, or Flitwick, or Snape, or heck, even Quirrell of all people, would have tried protections that, I don't know, a first year can't get around, if they were smart teachers?  

I mean, McGonagall! You are a wise witch, yet you make your protection a game of chess? Quirrell, you don't want anyone interfering with your plans to get the stone, yet you make your protection the same species of Troll that first years have been proven to be able to defeat, with *no training*? Come on!

And Dumbledore! You decide to protect this stone with tons of protections, only to decide later to destroy it? Why didn't you destroy it *in the first place*?!? You were able to talk Flamel into destroying it at the end of the year! Surely if you decided the stone must be protected at the beginning of the year, that you could talk to him earlier about destroying it instead of going through the trouble of ""protecting it""?

Why make these protections passable by everyone in the first place? Why wouldn't you lock that trapdoor under the dog with magic that repels alohamora? Why don't you make it so none of the flying keys fit into the door, and make it so only Flitwick knows how to open it? Why provide brooms for that one anyways? Why not just make the teacher for every protection be the only one that knows how to get passed it?

I mean, really. This just really bugged me. I know it was supposed to be easier than challenges later on, because of how the series is supposed to progress, but, in the real world, these teachers should have been way smarter.

Sorry this is so long, I just had to get this out there."

Question about HBP,"I'm currently re-reading HBP while Binge Mode discusses it and something dawned on me.

Why Voldemort couldn‚Äôt touch Harry,"I think Dumbledore‚Äôs explanation that it was because of Harry‚Äôs mom‚Äôs sacrifice and love is too kid-friendly. 

I think Voldemort couldn‚Äôt touch Harry because of the horcrux in Harry. The horcrux is a bit of Voldemort‚Äôs soul, and since he didn‚Äôt plan on making Harry a horcrux, Harry had more ‚Äúsoul‚Äù that was pure than Voldemort. Voldemort couldn‚Äôt touch him because Voldemort didn‚Äôt have much ‚Äúsoul‚Äù left, and what he did have wasn‚Äôt pure enough to withstand touching Harry. 

Presumably, Voldemort would‚Äôve had the same reaction if he would‚Äôve tried to touch someone else that had a pure soul. But he didn‚Äôt.  Voldemort doesn‚Äôt seem like a very tactile person anyway, and we never really saw him holding hands with any of the good guys. The only people Voldemort would‚Äôve touched, would be people who have stains on their souls from acts they committed to be faithful to him, be it murder or torture.

Theory on Maledictus' and how they transform for ever (Crimes of Grindelwald spoilers),"So I have been thinking and you guys seem to like the idea in [this coment](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9ju4bf/the_hero_we_need_right_now/e6u9inb?utm_source=reddit-android) that Human Nagini might be good and the Snake Nagini evil.  Then I replyed to a comenter (I don't want to see anyone downvote him please we where sharing thoughts lets respect everyone's speach plz) and proposed the idea that maybe the Women and Snake Nagini and two seperate enteties (like when Ginny is possested by the memory of Tom in CoS) (or maybe she can remember, like if she were a spectator (like us in a movie theater, we can't interact with the movie, we can only sit and watch) and sees everything Snake Nagini does, but can't interact with her.

So bassicaly Women Nagini would be a nice person fearing her condition and fearing that she will lose her humanity.  In a tweet (couldn't find it I swear this acting controversy has made it so much harder to find) Claudia Kim or JK Rowling say that Nagini will be fighting for her humanity, not wanting to turn into the beasts we know she will become.

And then I wondered, what if Maledictus' turn forever into a beast because their beast form (wich I have theoriesed of being a seperate entity) because the beast wants to be present full time.  What if the Snake wasn't powerfull enough until 25+ years to stay completely into snake form and that the Human Nagini is powerfull enough to change back into a human.  And then, at some point Snake Nagini would be more powerfull that Human Nagini and the Snake would be in control.  (This is working great, it explains why Humain Nagini will be afraid of her snake form and maybe we could see her randomly transform into a snake only because the snake entity is itself wanting to be a full-time being).

So to recapitulate, when a Maledictus is in a form (lets say human) it has its other form (snake of Nagini's case) in itself and it can see what the other one is doing (the same aplyes vice-versa).  Then when Human Nagini transform is at will until the Snake's Maledictus powers become too powerfull, so it isn't that the curse will enevitably transform Nagini into a snake, but more like the Snake will have enough power to stay into Snake form forever, but the Snake can still chose to become humain, but since it isn't really her, why would she do so?

Maybe the snake gathers more power as she is present in the real world.

REGARDING THE NEW FBAWTFT TRAILER... [spoilers!],"Forgive me if I go wrong somewhere, but am I missing something?

So, I watched the new Crimes of Grindelwald trailer when it came out and was absolutely surprised (understatement) at the nagini scene. But this is my take on it:

What if Nagini was actually an animagus from around Grindelwald's time (a really evil one) and Voldemort named his pet snake (and horcrux) after her in her honour? He was realy into all that legacy stuff and probably Nagini was a dark witch who had a major impact on him during his early years. 

I didn't see anything that directly correlates the Nagini in the trailer with the same Nagini that we came to know.

I have come across many people who were literally ripping into the new trailer just because they didn't agree with the 2 Naginis being the same.

Maybe time will tell when the movie comes out.

Any feedback will be appreciated.

What if Nagini was actually an animagus from around Grindelwald's time (a really evil one) and Voldemort named his pet snake (and horcrux) after her in her honour? He was realy into all that legacy stuff and probably Nagini was a dark witch who had a major impact on him during his early years. 

I didn't see anything that directly correlates the Nagini in the trailer with the same Nagini that we came to know.

I have come across many people who were literally ripping into the new trailer just because they didn't agree with the 2 Naginis being the same.

Maybe time will tell when the movie comes out.

Any feedback will be appreciated.

Theory regarding SPOILER from Fantastic Beasts trailer,"Nagini is Voldemort's mother.

Okay, sounds crazy but hear me out...

People have speculated that Fantastic Beasts will tie in to Voldemort's birth, due to the fact first movie takes place in 1926. Voldemort (Tom Riddle) is born of Merope Gaunt on December 31st 1926. A [poster](https://imgur.com/i6Ime2f) seen in the first Fantastic Beasts movie speaks of a circus called the Circus Arcanus moving from New York to Europe on December 13th 1926. The last trailer for the new Fantastic Beasts movie confirms that the ""snake girl"" who is part of the circus is Nagini, a [maledictus](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1044584072285052930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1044584072285052930&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elitedaily.com%2Fp%2Fis-nagini-voldemorts-mom-this-fantastic-beasts-2-theory-is-blowing-fans-minds-12032305) who will go on to become Voldemort's pet snake. This is a secret [Rowling](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1044579634581401600) says she has carried for 20 years. So we have Nagini in the right location and the right time, but that is no confirmation that Nagini is Merope Gaunt.

In Half-Blood Prince, we find out from Mrs Cole that Merope arrived at Wool's orphanage, gave birth to Tom Riddle, and died soon after, though I believe Merope faked her own death. Cole says:

&gt;""*I remember she said to me 'I hope he looks like his papa', and I won't lie she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty ‚Äî and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father ‚Äî yes, I know, funny name, isn't it? We wondered whether she came from a* ***circus""***

So this could be a coincidence, but it seems Rowling may already have had the idea that Merope/Nagini was part of the Circus Arcanus. Perhaps Merope was looking ugly due to her upcoming permanent transformation into a snake. Perhaps Merope gave her child to an orphanage before faking her own death and running away so she would not harm her child after her snake transformation. The Gaunts after all are desceneded from Salazar Slytherin - what better family to carry a snake curse?

If this were true, and Voldemort was the child of the maledictus Nagini, it would explain Nagini's maternal relationship with Voldemort in the books. If the two were able to communicate via parseltongue, this theory would explain why Voldemort is so fond of Nagini, entrusting her to become a Horcrux. Voldemort drinks Nagini's venom to regain strength in his baby-form in Goblet of Fire, an obvious parallel to mother's milk. It may even explain why Voldemort develops snake-like characteristics. But craziest of all is how this might explain how Voldemort was able to recover to a baby-form at all. Rowling once discussed the things that were too dark to describe in the Harry Potter series:

&gt;""*There are two things that I think are too horrible, actually, to go into detail about. One of them is how Pettigrew brought Voldemort back into a rudimentary body. Because I told my editor what I thought happened there, and she looked as though she was going to vomit."" \[The other was how a horcrux is made\]*

In Goblet of Fire, Voldemort describes how:

&gt;""*Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own...with a little help from my dear Nagini""*

Maybe the reason Voldemort was able to regain a baby-form was that his own mother, Nagini, gave birth to him again. As Nagini contained a piece of Voldemort's soul, maybe Voldemort's soul joined with Nagini's piece of soul, which would later be given a body through childbirth. Perhaps the image that made Rowling's editor vomit was that of a snake having sex with Wormtail in rat-form to conceive Voldemort for a second time.

It's smarter for him to use woods native to Britain or Europe so he doesn't have to travel abroad to stock up on materials.

Snakewood is originally from South America, so we know the continent provides wand quality wood. Among the wands I've seen made out of exotic South American woods are Purpleheart, Jatoba, Bloodwood, Lignum Vitae, Canarywood, Padauk, Gonco Alves and lots of others.

I don't know what kind of substances might be used as cores. Though South America does contain the peruvian Vipertooth breed of Dragon, so Dragon Heartstring is likely used. What do you think?
 ",0,"Lets speculate about South American Wandlore! I've been fascinated with South American magic this week. Students of Castelobruxo are especially advanced in Herbology and Magizoology. That seems the perfect combination for wandmaking. (I really hope Jo writes a chunk of backstory for it at some point, though I don't know how likely that is, since we may never go there in Fantastic Beasts, and she never released backstory for France and Beauxbatons... maybe she's done with her extra content?)

To all the people shipping nagini and Voldemort,"I really think it makes more sense to have Voldemort meet nagini when she‚Äôs already succumbed to her curse - ie she only exists in snake form.

Two plot-holes that could have been exploited to extreme lengths,"There are two plot-holes in the Harry Potter books that I really can't understand how even Rowling could have allowed to pass.

&amp;#x200B;

One is with the owls that carry letters to other wizards. They have been shown to be able to find anyone without being told where they are; Hedwig found Sirius after he had left Britain after the third book even though Harry had no idea where Sirius was! So, why didn't the Ministry just send an owl to whatever criminal they wanted to catch and then have a group of aurors follow it on broomsticks?

&amp;#x200B;

The other is far **far FAR** bigger. During the Fourth Book, Harry is chosen as Triwizard Champion due to Crouch Jr putting his name into the Goblet, and he cannot decline to participate **because of the Goblet acting as a binding magical contract**. If it was possible to bind someone to a contract like that then there would have been dozens of Dark Wizards in history that enslaved people with that method! It would have been so easy to enslave others, yet no one ever did it!! So how the hell can Harry be bound by a contract **he did not sign!?!?**",0,"Two plot-holes that could have been exploited to extreme lengths There are two plot-holes in the Harry Potter books that I really can't understand how even Rowling could have allowed to pass.

Here's a question I've always had about the wizarding world...,"Now let me start by saying I am not trying to offend anyone here, and if I do I apologize in advance. Question I have is, are there any wizards with Down Syndrome, Autism, or some other mental disability? I mean you could not give a magical child with some of these conditions a wand. They could accidentally cause a lot of damage or reveal their world to muggles. Is there maybe a spell that cures these disabilities at birth? Is it the right thing to do to change they way they are? Or does magical blood not allow people to be born with these conditions? Any thoughts, opinions, and theories would be appreciated. ",0,"Here's a question I've always had about the wizarding world...

Remember that Harry Potter board game I made? I translated it for you and now you can make your own for free!," In May 2016 you asked me to shut up and take your galleons when I showed you my handmade Harry Potter inspired board game. I came up with the idea 4 years ago, and ever since I've worked on it and tested it to make it as good as possible.

I wanted to make a different type of game, where everyone can feel included and have fun no matter their knowledge or skills. And so I came up with a mix between a quiz and a party game. I also wanted to make it feel magical, so there's a lot of different parts, like wands and elixirs and a board inpired by the Maurauders map. [Here's a pic of a lot of it](https://i.imgur.com/DNJa2Nn.jpg), but there's more.

![img](wzl6s25o81p11)

Ever since your enthusiasm for it two years ago I've been working on translating it from my native Norwegian into English, and make instructions for how to print it and make it, that I hope anyone will be able to use. And now I present to you:

**""Mischief at Hogwarts""** (Norwegian: ""Ugagn p√• Galtvort"").

The players are students arriving at Hogwarts for an exciting year of adventures: You learn to master spells, duels, potions and pass your exams before facing Voldemort himself. Here spells fly in all directions, so wands at the ready if you please!

Life Debts?,"So I‚Äôm confused about something. 

Say somebody is alone and in active danger that they would not be able to survive on their own. Wandless and being burned at the stake, for example, or running from a werewolf or basilisk or something. 

You show up and save them by getting them out of active danger, and then you take them to a healer. The healer treats them from life-threatening wounds they sustained while they were in active danger. 

Without your help, they would have died right there, unable to get to a healer. Nobody else would have found or saved them. But without the healer, they would have just died later, because you‚Äôre not a healer and were unable to treat the extent of their injuries. 

In this situation, do they owe you a life debt, or the healer? Or both? 

And, relatedly, do healers just rack up life debts? Or does it not count because they‚Äôre required by oath to save you, and therefore didn‚Äôt choose to? Is the choice part important? 

I read the wikia article about Life Debts, and the JKR interview it linked to, and the info was worse than useless, so I guess there‚Äôs room for interpretation. I‚Äôm interested to see how everyone else views it :) ",0,"Life Debts? So I‚Äôm confused about something.

The Crimes of Grindelwald Scene I NEED,"Movie opens. It's New Years Eve 1926. As snow falls, Newt and Dumbledore are walking down the bitter cold streets of London, through a crowd of New Years Eve celebrators, catching up on the events of movie 1. Grindelwald is in prison and there is a calm in the air that wasn't there before. Newt is now focused on finding Credence. Dumbledore tells him what he has found out through the grapevine, that Credence may be in Paris. Newt is caught up in his own thoughts and runs straight into a very pregnant woman in the crowd. She is knocked to the ground and Newt, mortified, rushes to help her up and apologizes profusely.  She whispers an apology as well and moves to leave, her eyes never leaving the ground. Before she can leave, Newt stops her. He has noticed her shabby garb, which is not nearly enough for the cold weather, so he gives her his scarf. She says a soft thank you and walks a bit more down the street, where Newt watches her enter an orphanage. Newt and Dumbledore walk away and continue their conversation about Credence. Offscreen and outside the knowledge of the characters of FB2, the woman gives birth to a son within the hour. The woman tells the Matron of the orphanage, Mrs. Cole, that the baby should be named Tom Marvolo Riddle. Mrs Cole thinks ""Marvolo"" is a funny name and wonders if this young girl had come from the circus. There was a rather famous one called ""Circus Arcanus"" everyone seemed to be talking about lately. She had seen the adverts around town and was quite intrigued by the ""Enchanting Snake Girl"" act. Perhaps she would take some of the older children to Paris to see it the new year, if she could get the funds.

It's New Years Eve 1926. As snow falls, Newt and Dumbledore are walking down the bitter cold streets of London, through a crowd of New Years Eve celebrators, catching up on the events of movie 1. Grindelwald is in prison and there is a calm in the air that wasn't there before. Newt is now focused on finding Credence. Dumbledore tells him what he has found out through the grapevine, that Credence may be in Paris. Newt is caught up in his own thoughts and runs straight into a very pregnant woman in the crowd. She is knocked to the ground and Newt, mortified, rushes to help her up and apologizes profusely.  She whispers an apology as well and moves to leave, her eyes never leaving the ground. Before she can leave, Newt stops her. He has noticed her shabby garb, which is not nearly enough for the cold weather, so he gives her his scarf. She says a soft thank you and walks a bit more down the street, where Newt watches her enter an orphanage. Newt and Dumbledore walk away and continue their conversation about Credence. Offscreen and outside the knowledge of the characters of FB2, the woman gives birth to a son within the hour. The woman tells the Matron of the orphanage, Mrs. Cole, that the baby should be named Tom Marvolo Riddle. Mrs Cole thinks ""Marvolo"" is a funny name and wonders if this young girl had come from the circus. There was a rather famous one called ""Circus Arcanus"" everyone seemed to be talking about lately. She had seen the adverts around town and was quite intrigued by the ""Enchanting Snake Girl"" act. Perhaps she would take some of the older children to Paris to see it the new year, if she could get the funds.

Hogwarts: An Evolution Through Magic and Media,,0,
HP critique,"The dullest franchises in the history of movie franchises. Each episode  following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they  fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others.  Aside from the gloomy imagery, the series‚Äô only consistency has been its  lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects, all to make  magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.  
 

Perhaps the die was cast when Rowling vetoed the idea of Spielberg  directing the series; she made sure the series would never be mistaken  for a work of art that meant anything to anybody?just ridiculously  profitable cross-promotion for her books. The Harry Potter series might  be anti-Christian (or not), but it‚Äôs certainly the anti-James Bond  series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to  face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.

 ""No!""  
 The writing is dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed  that every time a character went for a walk, the author wrote instead  that the character ""stretched his legs.""  
 

I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was  repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen  times. I was incredulous. Rowling's mind is so governed by cliches and  dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing. Later I read a  lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote  something to the effect of, ""If these kids are reading Harry Potter at  11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen  King."" And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you read  ""Harry Potter"" you are, in fact, trained to read Stephen King.                  ",0,"HP critique The dullest franchises in the history of movie franchises.

In 1993 the full moon was on the night of August 31st, the day before the train to Hogwarts. If we assume that Snape had given Lupin the Wolfsbane potion for that transformation, that would explain why Lupin was so tired the next day, and why he slept through the majority of the train ride.
He would've been transformed and up all night the previous night.

[Fan Theory] The founders' contributions,"After rereading Chamber of Secrets I think that all four of the founders of Hogwarts had a secret room in the castle.

The door to the headmaster's office is hidden behind a gargoyle. making it a great place for a secret/private study. Not the sort of place for a headmaster office. Since it requires a password to enter that makes it too private for an office that students, parents, and occasional government officials. An office that would be designed for such public use would not use a password, because if one student goes to the office, which happens many times with just the few students we know of, then it's likely that the entire student body could have that password. So either it was designed to change password after any not faculty visit, or it was not originally designed as the headmaster's office. With the griffin door knocker I think it was originally Gryffindor's private office that later generations converted into the headmaster's office because it was the nicest.

The other secret room in the castle that is never given a clear origin is the room of requirement. A room accessed by mental concentration, with it's own imagination. A room that can be an office, storage room, apartment, bathroom, and really anything if the user has the imagination to think it up. The perfect place for a witch that values intelligence and creativity. This was created by Ravenclaw for her private use. It becomes the resting place for her diadem. It is also mentioned by Ravenclaw's own daughter, one of the few characters that would have been alive during the founding and would have know about her mother's private room.

Hufflepuff on the other hand was not about secret chambers, or offices. She believed any and everyone should be allowed in the school. Her egalitarian philosophy would therefore not be focused on separating herself from the school but protecting every member of the school regardless of house/class. She created the statues and enchanted armor that protects the school during the battle of Hogwarts.

Why didn't Voldemort try to MAKE the sorcerer's stone,"The whole point of Voldemort as a character is that he's a brilliant wizard who can't accept death and will go to any lengths to achieve immortality. This makes him unique and terrifying.

However, it seems to be pretty common knowledge that Nicolas Flamel was able to make the sorcerer's stone and has just been chilling with his wife for 600+ years.

Why would a young Tom Riddle become so obsessed with Horcruxes and defiling his soul when it's already been proven possible to make a benign magical object that will do the same thing with less side effects? Because he's evil? Ok, maybe, but why not make both then? We know he tried to steal it, so why not use his genius to try and make one? Or at least kidnap Flamel and interrogate him.

Ron deserved a little more respect from Fred and George.,"So Ron helped Harry Save the Sorceror's stone, Helped save his own sister, helped save Sirius, helped harry survive the Ministry and still Fred and George gigged him a lot in books five and six.

Youd think theyd of eased up in book five. I know they did after Ron embarrassed himself on the pitch but still gave him a hard time in book six.

#Hogwarts Trick or Treat

We all know that the Halloween Feast is the centerpiece of Halloween at Hogwarts. But, this year the Muggle Studies professor wants to incorporate a muggle tradition of ‚ÄúTrick or Treat.‚Äù

The fun part is that we can use magic to make Trick or Treat a truly magical and creepy experience! Your job is to create both a magical trick, and a magical treat. Imagine you are designing a classroom where students will knock on the door, open it, say the magic phrase ‚ÄúTrick or Treat‚Äù and then, either your trick or treat will occur! 

* The trick may be anything you like. It may involve the whole room, be a prank, or even be something that appears to be a treat but is suddenly like being stuck in Fred and George‚Äôs bedroom! Just make it magical and something tricksy!

* The treat, as well, can be anything you like. The only requirement is that it should be something awesome! It may involve the entire room, be an awesome charm, delicious food, your imagination (and magical prowess) is your only restriction!

* Bonus points if upon the incantation the student can't tell if they are going to have a trick or a treat. 

---
You might submit your assignment in written, visual, musical, or any other format as you wish. Just have fun :)

###The due date for all submissions is 11:59 PM EST on Friday, October 27, 2017.



**Grading Format:**

Assignments will be given a grade with a numerical score shown below.

* Outstanding = 30 House Points
* Exceeds Expectations = 25 House Points
* Acceptable = 20 House Points
* Poor = 10 House Points
* Dreadful = 5 House Points



####**To submit a homework assignment, reply to the appropriate comment below.** You *do not* have to be a member of the common room's subreddit to submit homework, as long as you're only submitting to one house, and you may only submit one assignment for House Points. You are encouraged to have house flair, but it is not required to earn points.

Though this is a very small point, I think it's interesting that JK never wrote this way again after TPS. A big part of the series for me was that I genuinely never know if Harry was going to make it through each book, and her third-person writing style/lack of any future mentions definitely contributed to that.

Everyone else that was petrified saw the basilisk through some kind of lens/mirror/ghost. So wouldn't Harry only be petrified if he was still wearing his glasses?

I realize that Moaning Myrtle also wears glasses, but maybe she died because she had them on top of her head to wipe her eyes (because she was crying) when she looked the basilisk in the eye.

I mean, if he had only been petrified because of his glasses, the basilisk still would have just eaten him for dinner.

Is Crookshanks the kitten in the torn photograph?,"- In the torn photograph Harry finds in Sirius‚Äô bedroom, a baby Harry is chasing a kitten on his toy broom.
- The shop owner says that Crookshanks has been in the shop for years
- Crookshanks hates Scabbers/Peter and gets along with Sirius/Snuffles

Thoughts against this are:
- Crookshanks can sniff out dishonesty as mentioned in the book so it doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the one that betrayed my humans!‚Äù
- Sirius had to gain Crookshank‚Äôs trust, but that is also Sirius‚Äô point of view

"Fan fiction summaries where you are just left thinking ""Did these people even read the books""?","Thought it might be fun for people to post descriptions of either Harry Potter fan fiction they have read, or summaries of the stories from the authors themselves that, even though the author technically used the source material there is very little in terms of character personality or plot that makes you think these authors even read the books.

&gt;After Harry and Ron break up, Harry decides to make Ron jealous by hooking up with Draco. Draco has had a crush on Harry since the moment he'd first set eyes on him, but will Harry return Draco's feelings? And how will Ron feel when he finds out about all this?

Draco's Parenting Style,"After seeing The Cursed Child on stage, I was able to forgive some of the more questionable plot points they decided to go with. But one thing that I couldn't understand was Scorpius' personality. He was completely adorable, fun, quirky, likeable and about as far away from being Draco's son than I could imagine. Not only far from that, but also far from the personality of any Slytherin we have ever met. 

So I got to thinking. Draco was hugely influenced by his father and I wonder just how many of his decisions on how he treated others at Hogwarts were his own and not influenced by his dad (I'm betting not many). And then we see this change happen in Draco and understand in the sixth and seventh book that he really doesn't want to go through with this life that his dad wants (or thinks he wants). Despite that, however, Draco hasn't changed a lot 19 years later and still doesn't want to see Harry Potter, even though, you know, Harry risked his own life to save Draco's. 

SO what I'm getting at is, what if Draco DID change more than what we see. The only way I can see Scorpius coming into the caring, playful person that he is, is if Draco was truly a loving father who told Scorpius none of that old wizarding stuff mattered and really didn't care about his social status anymore. Draco still acts like a dick 19 years later, and even duels with Harry, but it's Harry that wants his son to stay away from Scorpius... not the other way around. 

I can imagine Draco raising Scorpius as a complete individual. Everything Scorpius ever decided on would have been HIS OWN choice. Because Draco never really got to choose anything for himself. And that's how we ended up with this beautiful version of a Malfoy, one who doesn't care about what other's think, one who isn't afraid to be himself and one who continuously tries to do what is right (even if what they believe is right is misguided). 

Just my thoughts/reasoning as to why Scorpius doesn't quite fit the mold of a Malfoy child. I'd love to hear what other's thing about Scorpius and Draco's parenting!

Was Stan Shunpike a deatheater or under the imperius curse?,"I don't think the book actually gives a definitive answer.  The closest thing I can find is how Harry describes Stan's face as ""strangely blank"" when he sees Stan with the deatheaters, but if the imperius curse was that easy to detect, it would be almost useless.  Maybe Stan just had an expressionless face at that moment.  Everything else I can find in the book seems to be speculation and denial from Harry and the rest.  I think Stan could have actually been a deatheater of his own accord.  Harry seems so sure that Stan couldn't be one, but his parents were sure Peter wasn't one too and they knew Peter a lot better than Harry knows Stan!  


We know Stan was put in Azkaban for claiming he's a deatheater and then escapes during the mass breakout.  He almost gets Harry and Hagrid killed on the journey to the Tonks' house when Harry disarms Stan instead of stunning him in the air.  Stan later ""sends business Fenrir Greyback's way,"" which leads to the snatchers knowing Ron is lying when he claims to be Stan.  


Maybe the ministry held Stan because they determined he was the real deal and Harry was just mistrustful of the ministry's decision after everything they put him through when Fudge was minister the year before.  But then again maybe I just want Stan to be a deatheater because it shows that even people you like and trust can be against you.

So my question are what are the rules regarding family members marrying other family members. Would it be the same in the muggle world or would the rules be more lax? For instance if Draco were to marry his cousin would the magical world care? Or on a more extreme level, if Ron and Ginny were caught snogging, would this be a massive social no no or would it actually be seen as somewhat normal?

I know it is an odd question, and a little bit gross to think about, but I am quite interested in the answers people have since the pool for purebloods is comparatively quite small.",0,"What are the magical social norms regarding incest?

I'm watching Fantastic Beasts right now.  It's actually the only HP universe movie I like, other that the first 3 of course.  And I enjoy it greatly up until wizards pull out wants and just fire away like their wands are some kind of laser pistol.

The people making these movies really have no imagination.  SMH

Edit: some people seem to be confused, and think that I'm bitching about how the spell casting looks.  That is not my problem.  My problem is that all these wizards do is fire the same stun or ""kill"" spells over and over.  Or send out ambiguous laserbeams at each other.  There's literally no imagination involved in what a wizard would do with a wand.  Especially in wizard battles.  I can predict right now exactly how the final battle between Dumbledoor and Grindlewald will look.  They will face off and start firing anonymous spells at each other, dodging and dancing around.  Probably with a lot more flash and flair, but that'll be about the extent of it.  And Dumbledore will eventually win.  Bloody boring as hell.",0,"The one thing I hate most about all of the Harry Potter movies... Magical bloody laserbeams.

Probable Plot hole in the fourth book with Snape's Legilimancy,"Finch, Mrs. Norris, Snape and Moody are all super close to Harry as Harry is stuck in the step under his invisibility cloak.  Harry is loudly pleading to Moody the Marauders Map is his. Wouldn't Snape know Harry is there since Snape is trying to find Harry. Snape should be able to search Harry with his mind or maybe I don't know how Legilimancy works.

Why Voldemort's Identity was a secret?,"I don't mean why the Half-blood Tom Riddle decided to hide his origins. I want to know why this secret wasn't made public (as far as I can remember no one seems to know who he was). 

Voldemort reigned through fear and deception, his 'name' was so feared that he was known as 'You know who'. 

Why not to humanize him and break the myth naming him by his simple and mundane name 'Tom Marlvoro Riddle'. Why Dumbledore didn't make this knowledge public?

Some thoughts about Petunia Dursley,"Near the end of our adventure with our hero, The Boy Who Lived, we are given a glimpse into the mind and the childhood of one Severus Snape.  And among the HP community, this is widely considered the point where our perspective of Snape completely changes.  It's what makes the chapter so important, it's where we read the word ""Always,"" it's where we learn that Snape loved Lily.  But it saddens me that in this revelation, another massive insight is usually completely overlooked by readers and that is insight into the mind of Petunia Dursley. 

The more I think about Petunia, the more I begin to understand how she felt and why she was the way she was towards Harry, and I'd like to discuss that idea with you guys.  First, let's establish something: Petunia also loved Lily, just as Snape did, and for just as long.  This may be hard to believe, but think about it for a second.  She took in a child that wasn't hers even though she had absolutely no obligation. She took Harry in because she knew it would protect him, that it would keep him safe, and an action like that comes from love.  When Vernon tried to kick Harry out in the fifth book, Petunia is the one who stops him. She may need some prodding from Dumbledore, but she puts her foot down and says Harry is staying. 

And not just that, there are other incidents that we can probably safely assume where Petunia stepped in to keep Harry in the house.  Look at all the things that happened throughout the seven years: Dobby dropping the pudding (plus the Weasleys breaking Harry out,) Harry blowing up Aunt Marge, Dudley's tongue...  I feel like Vernon hates Harry. He had no bond to James or Lily and didn't like them from the first time they met (according to Pottermore.). Its hard for me to believe that after any of these incidents, especially the Aunt Marge one, he would not have lost his temper and said they were throwing Harry out.  The only thing that stopped that was his wife... Because she loved Lily and deep down she loves Harry. So why does she treat him like crap?

This is where, I think, the greatest and most relatable part of Petunia comes in.  In DH, we learn that she was jealous of Lily; that she wanted to go to Hogwarts herself and was extremely upset that she couldn't.  Now, everyone here is a fan of this series. And I'd be willing to bet every person here has, at one point or another, wished they would've gotten their Hogwarts acceptance letter.  Now imagine tomorrow, you found out it was all real.  And then imagine that your brother, or sister, or cousin, or someone close to you got to go and you didn't. Imagine they got an acceptance letter and got to go get robes and an owl and a wand. You would be heartbroken, or at least I know I would.  Especially if I were a kid at the time it happened, full of hopes and dreams and wonder. 

Petunia had to grow up seeing that.  She had to see Lily come home each year with these amazing candies, and these awesome spell books and a cool wizards hat and all this other stuff that she could never have or experience.  Imagine what that would do to a little kid.  It's no wonder she ended up hating magic. I don't even think she hated it, she just used hatred to mask her jealousy.  And even then, she might have gotten over that if it weren't for her marrying Vernon Dursley.  Mr. Dursley was a steel reinforcement to her hatred and his hatred for all things abnormal just further justified her views on magic.  But again, how could she not resent magic when she had seen all the wonders it held?

Still, she took Harry in. She protected him, she fed him and clothed him (albeit, not well) but she really wasn't any worse to him than Snape was.  So I feel like maybe we should take a second look at Petunia Dursley. What do you guys think? As we all know, things in Harry Potter aren't usually as Black and White as they first appear, or should I say, they aren't always as red and green.

Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione get together at the Yule Ball. How would the books be different?,"So I know it is not super realistic since Harry was not even interested in Ginny back then but imagine Ginny had not been asked by Neville, and when Ron suggested Harry go with Ginny she accepted, and also imagine Ron, deciding it was a good idea to ask Hermione immediately after hearing of the Yule Ball (as she is a girl, and even before the Yule Ball he knew he liked her as a person) and Hermione accepts to invitation. 

So now Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione go to the Yule Ball together? How do you think those dates would go?

Also, now lets assume they go well, and suddenly Harry is dating Ginny, and Ron is dating Hermione. How would the books be different?

So assuming that the end game is still Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny I think it would create some interesting changes. The Ron/Lavender plot would be gone in HBP and we would get a lot more Ginny in the story as well.

I think if Harry and Ginny got together then we would have found a way to include Ginny in the horcrux hunt which I think might have been really interesting. Also, with Ron and Hermione having been together for years I don't see the locket affecting Ron in the same way as it did the books.

Also rather than the teenage drama we got in HBP, we would instead get something different, as both couples had their ups and downs, all 4 of them trying to navigate their way through new feelings and new relationships. I think it would have been fun to read the starts of both relationships, and the ups and downs before both couples really settled into those relationships.

So the general premise is JKR wants the same canon pairings to happen, but she wanted both couples to get together around the Yule Ball instead of part way through HBP and the end of DH's.

Does anyone know if the MuggleNet Academia podcast is still accessible?,"Hi all,

I recently heard about the MuggleNet Academia podcast and decided to check it out. I know that new episodes are no longer being produced, but I thought that the old episodes would at least be accessible.

I also checked out Google Play and some other podcast sites, and I'm not seeing any way to listen to episodes.

A theory about Harry and Voldemort's eye colors...,"Hello all!  I've been thinking a lot about something and I want your all's opinions and thoughts on it.  So, we are repeatedly told throughout the series that Harry has strikingly green eyes.  We are also told that Voldemort has blazing red eyes. For many years, I never really thought about this; it was simply a detail to make Voldemort more menacing and evil and a random description JK picked when she was coming up with Harry's appearance.  Here lately though, I've been wondering if there might be more to it. 

Color symbolism plays a big part in the HP series, as we all know.  Red is almost always associated with Gryffindor, with Harry, with the good guys.  Green, on the other hand, is the color of Slytherin, the color of the Avada Kedavra curse, the color that represents evil in the HP universe. So, why then, would JK pick those two colors specifically to represent the main antagonist and protagonist, but opposite of how we usually see the colors?  It could simply be a minor detail that JK randomly decided on when writing, but these days, it's hard to think anything JK wrote in these books was unintentional.  I think there is more to it than just random design choice, so here is my theory:

The colors of their eyes are completely intentional and are used to symbolize that people aren't always black and white.  Harry has many of the qualities that we associate with Slytherin. He is cunning, resourceful, he has a... Certain disregard for the rules. But he was still placed in Gryffindor.  Voldemort, on the other hand, has many qualities we associate with Gryffindor.  He is brave, he is daring, and he has nerves of steel. But he was still placed in Slytherin.  My theory is that their eye color shows this. That they both possess these traits of the house they oppose, but those traits are not the biggest part of them.  They make up a small part of Harry and a small part of Voldemort.  Their actions, as Dumbledore says, are much more of who they are than their natural abilities. 

So while Harry has Slytherin traits and Voldemort has Gryffindor traits, those traits are just a small part of them. Just like how your eye color is a small part of your appearance. I might be reading too much into this, so I'd love to hear your all's thoughts on this!  Was the choice of eye color intentional and symbolic, or am I just being a crazy fan and reading too much into something small?",0,"A theory about Harry and Voldemort's eye colors... Hello all!

How active would the trio (and Ginny) be in the muggle world after the books?,"Basically the question is in the title. How much time do you think the trio and Ginny would spend in the muggle world after the books, and also, how much would the 4 of them know about the muggle world? 

For me I think

**Hermione** would always have a strong connection to the muggle world because of her parents. She considers herself a witch but at the same time she also values the fact she was born and raised as a muggle, giving her a perspective on the magical world that others might not have. I also think she would hate the idea of being like those witches or wizards who know nothing about the magical world. I think she would strongly believe that her children should go to school in a muggle school before turning 11 and going to Hogwarts.

**Ron** I think based on the epilogue that Ron would secretly love learning a lot more about the muggle world and while he might be considered a little odd sometimes by some muggles he would actually fit in quite well. Plus I think he would feel a real sense of accomplishment in learning and using muggle technology so if they could get it to work I could see Ron wanting to own a TV or a computer. He would also spend a reasonable amount of time in the muggle world because of his in laws being muggle, and he would very much want to impress them.

**Harry** is much more tough as he was never happy in the muggle world and once the books are over there is nothing really tying him to the muggle world unlike Ron and Hermione who would both have ties. I could see Harry sort of slowly just spending time in the magical world, sometimes going into the muggle world simply so he does not get recognised but beyond that he wouldn't really have a connection to it. I also think Ginny would end up home schooling their children so there would be no muggle connection there.

**Ginny** would definitely not have the connection. She might share her fathers general interest in things muggle but she wouldn't have the ability to really experience it like Ron would (since Ron is married to a muggle born who would want him to learn). Ginny might pick up some muggle things from Hermione (I see Ginny loving the idea of muggle fashion, especially on women) but I don't see her knowing a lot about the non-magical world.

What do you think?",0,"How active would the trio (and Ginny) be in the muggle world after the books? Basically the question is in the title. How much time do you think the trio and Ginny would spend in the muggle world after the books, and also, how much would the 4 of them know about the muggle world? 

For me I think

**Hermione** would always have a strong connection to the muggle world because of her parents. She considers herself a witch but at the same time she also values the fact she was born and raised as a muggle, giving her a perspective on the magical world that others might not have. I also think she would hate the idea of being like those witches or wizards who know nothing about the magical world. I think she would strongly believe that her children should go to school in a muggle school before turning 11 and going to Hogwarts.

**Ron** I think based on the epilogue that Ron would secretly love learning a lot more about the muggle world and while he might be considered a little odd sometimes by some muggles he would actually fit in quite well.

What's the best and what's the worst Harry Potter book?,"If you had to rank them, what's at the top what's at the bottom? I know they're all great but one has to be the least, and one has to have a special place in your heart.

For me it's Order of the Phoenix, great action, humour, characters and a the theme of fighting against a shitty government.

The least is probably Philosopher's Stone for me, just cause, like a pilot for a TV show, it feels kinda weak compared to the other brilliant books plus it was JK's first novel, she didn't reach her prowess in writing until about halfway through the series. It's still great just not as good as the other peices of art she wrote.",0,"What's the best and what's the worst Harry Potter book? If you had to rank them, what's at the top what's at the bottom?

Did anyone file a complaint against Dolores Umbridge after OoTP?,"

Ok, Harry is so angry that ministry had retained Umbridge. But, can a ministry employee be fired just like that? A great deal of things she did were approved by the Ministry itself. Isn't there a procedure? The accused can be suspended for a period while the higher authority conduct enquiries and perhaps subject her to a trial. Why didn't Harry file a complaint rather than sulking and shouting to Scrimgeour?

Any Puffs out there with Loot Crate and Newt Scarf?,"Ey, been thinking about getting a scarf this year for the winter, my first and figured, why not make it a Hufflepuff scarf.      
I was looking at the Newt Scarf, this one, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LYIKA89 then came along the Crate and that one looks rather nice as well.      
Does anyone have both to compare?  I'm wondering about the length, thickness and the colors.      
It looks to be a brighter Yellow and darker Black, leaning more towards Yellow and Black rather than Orange and Grey.      

From the very few pictures I have seen it looks like the better scarf, though it will also cost me at least $10 more, if it ever shows up on ebay long enough for me to grab that is.",0,"Any Puffs out there with Loot Crate and Newt Scarf?

Professor Binns and the Questionable Ethics of Employing Ghosts,"I just got to thinking about this the other day as I was rereading some of the early books. How is it ethical to employ a non-living entity for perpetuity? Especially when they have no means of receiving a paycheck and little use for anything they could conceivably buy with money. I know that no one is forcing Professor Binns to continue working (apparently he was a professor while alive and just continued teaching after he died like nothing had happened), but shouldn't Dumbledore or one of the previous headmasters have stepped in and forced him to retire? Even if just for the sake of his students who have to listen to him drone on endlessly in his uninspiring lectures. He is at the very least an ineffectual instructor. Why not simply relegate him to an empty classroom somewhere? Or wandering a hallway like all the other ghosts in the school. Is Hogwarts just being cheap and keeping him so they don't have to hire a real person to teach History of Magic? Just like how they employ house elves to work in the kitchens because they don't have to pay them. Isn't working without being paid the definition of slavery?

As it's been a while since we've had this discussion. . . What is your Hogwarts house? What is your Illvermorny house? Have they changed over time?,"Also, as a side discussion. . . Does anyone feel that the official Sorting Quiz on Pottermore has done far more damage than it has good?

I mean I've seen it multiple times, people who are so sad they got the wrong house, and continue to go on with their lives believing they are what the Quiz said, and being heavily disappointed. But no one, except for a magical hat, could ever tell you where you belong. Only you can do that.

I know Rowling wrote it, and it's just supposed to be for fun, but I genuinely think it's a BAD quiz in my opinion. Most all the questions have *nothing to do* with determining who you are. Heads or tails? Dusk or Dawn? I get that Dusk fits Slytherin thematically, but you're really going to tell a person they don't belong in this house because they prefer sunrises to sunsets?

Please, if you took the quiz and were disappointed. . . Rethink things. Use your own judgement, and provide your best guess as to what house you think you would be sorted into, not the internet's, and not even the author's final word. Only *you* know you. Well, you and the magic hat.

Harry Potter 8 idea,"So i recently watched the Harry Potter and the cursed child play for the first time and i gotta say... it was just Justin Bieber and Hitler conbined.

But anyway i had a idea pop into my head about a remake of the 8th installment of the series, not a remake like remake the entire Cursed child but a different story altogether.

Quick note: If it is possible anyone else has already thought of this idea then know this, i didn't steal it i came up with it myself. And also this idea can only apply to the book version since in the movie Harry breaks the elder wand.

It is called: Harry Potter and the hunt for the deathly hallows.

Basically, the plot is that it does take place 19 years later (of course) and that a secret cult is living in the mountains above Hogwarts, they have a goal: to find and unite all 3 deathly hallows and become the most powerful beings in the world, kinda like but at the same time unlike Voldermort because they want all 3 hallows not just the elder wand. Harry Potter discovers the cult and their goal while on a task as his job as a auror, he is captured and tortured for the hallows's locations which Harry dosen't give, the cult then announce to Harry they will capture his loved ones and torture them as they wont be as good against the imperius curse, filled with rage Harry manages to escape.

The cult capture Harry and Ginny's as well as Ron and Hermione's children.

Now Harry, Ron and Hermione are now on a quest to get to the deathly hallows and recover them. the elder wand is in dumbledore's tomb, the cloak of invisibility in Albus's bed at Hogwarts and the resurrection stone is lost in the forbidden forest,  they know where they are but with the cult one step behind them and loved ones in danger they need to work together like never before.

I've always been frustrated by one part of the first book,"I'm sure this will be an unpopular opinion because I'm going to complain about an element of JK's writing, but I gotta get this out. 

So in the first book, during the Potions Trial as Harry and Hermione are trying to go save the Philosopher's Stone, JK spends an entire page writing out this entire riddle associated with the potion bottles and how to select the right one. An important part of the riddle refers to the sizes, shapes, and locations of the bottles with respect to each other. My only complaint about this scene is that JK doesn't give the reader enough information about the exact setup of the bottles for the reader to be able to solve the riddle themselves.

Hermione says something like, ""Oh, it's a logic puzzle, gimme a sec, I'll have this solved."" And then a few seconds pass and she says something like ""Here, Harry, take this one, I'll take this one, trust me I'm smart."" 

I feel like this whole scene was lazily put together from a writing perspective. If we think about this somewhat philosophically, the puzzle of the potions doesn't even exist. There is no puzzle. There never was a challenge for the characters to get through, there never was any danger, the scene holds absolutely no plot-driving weight. We don't even get so much as an explanation from Hermione on her logic in the solution. She just simply comes up with the solution, and we are supposed to trust her word. I know she's smart, but still, I don't even learn anything about HOW smart she is from this scene.

For example, I'm writing a story, and it goes like this: ""James and his dad are walking along, and his dad says, 'James, I'm going to ask you a question, and if you get it wrong, you'll die.' James answered correctly. 'Good job, James!' said his dad.""

My example is trying to explain the frustration I feel towards this scene. There is no emotional weight, no real sense of dynamic plot involved in this scene. I would have rather had JK include a paragraph describing the layout of the bottles with enough detail for the puzzle to be solvable by the reader. Because the solution does not exist within the words of the book, the puzzle is not real, there is no riddle. 

I hope someone shares in my feelings, or wants to offer an explanation of sorts. Thanks for reading.",0,"I've always been frustrated by one part of the first book I'm sure this will be an unpopular opinion because I'm going to complain about an element of JK's writing, but I gotta get this out.

For example, I'm writing a story, and it goes like this: ""James and his dad are walking along, and his dad says, 'James, I'm going to ask you a question, and if you get it wrong, you'll die.' James answered correctly. 'Good job, James!' said his dad.""

My example is trying to explain the frustration I feel towards this scene. There is no emotional weight, no real sense of dynamic plot involved in this scene. I would have rather had JK include a paragraph describing the layout of the bottles with enough detail for the puzzle to be solvable by the reader. Because the solution does not exist within the words of the book, the puzzle is not real, there is no riddle. 

I hope someone shares in my feelings, or wants to offer an explanation of sorts. Thanks for reading."

How much of a role did the movies play in the potter mania craze of the 2000s?,"The books are the biggest phenomena in literature in decades. With or without the movies, the books are massively popular and will be read for many more years. It is a rare case where the books might have been read more than their respective movies being watched. So my question is, how much contribution did the movies have in the mass hysteria that the series had in the 2000s? Like LOTR became massive again when the PJ movies cale out, or how the ASOIF series has gained SO many readers because of the show, mostly books gain much more popularity once they have adaptions. I remember the movies also having a lot of anticipation. All movies usually broke records of some kind on release, amd even when the books ended, the films continued to maintain their viewers, peaking with the last film. All 3 main actors were global superstars during that time, similar to what many pop stars are today. So it seems the movies did have a significant role in the popularity of HP as a whole.

[Spoilers] I figured out Dumbledore's plan for DH,"SPIOLER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!

I should start by saying that when I figured this out I felt like I'd won the Tri-Wizard Cup. Anyway, here goes...

Dumbledore had Snape kill him, for multiple reasons. It was beacuse:

1. He was already dying from the curse on Marvolo Gaunt's ring. (Shown in Snape's memories)

2. He knew it would put Snape in Voldemort's good graces, allowing him to continue his mission. (Evidenced by Voldemort WAITING for Snape before starting the meeting at the beginning of Deathly Hallows [He's never waited on anyone else before])

3. Dumbledore knew about Draco being ordered to kill him; adding to this, he knew that when Voldemort went after the Elder Wand he would target whoever had killed him. (In Half-Blood Prince [movie] you can actually see Dumbledore hold his wand out as a clear target and do nothing to stop Draco. And in Snape's memories, we actually see conversations with Dumbledore that nod toward him setting all this up)

Since Voldemort believed that you have to kill the previous owner to gain mastery of the wand (as we see when he kills Snape at the Battle of Hogwarts). By having Draco disarm him and Snape kill him, Draco gains mastery of the wand; yet Voldemort believes it is Snape because he was the one to kill Dumbledore. In doing so, he ensures that Voldemort won't gain true mastery of the wand and also sets in momotion key events of Deathly Hallows.",0,"[Spoilers] I figured out Dumbledore's plan for DH SPIOLER ALERT!!!

I just finished my first re-read of the series since Deathly Hallows came out. It feels just as bittersweet now as it did ten years ago.,"Spoilers ahead, if anyone is still concerned about that.

With all ""20 years of HP"" stuff that happened this summer, it being the 10 year anniversary of DH, and 2017 also being 19 Years Later, I got a craving to re-read the series after I finished the Count of Monte Cristo in June. 

I know a lot of people here have done numerous re-reads over the years, and have probably seen the movies a million times as well. As the title indicated, I obviously hadn't, and other than seeing the movies when they first came out and seeing bits and pieces of certain ones on TV during Harry Potter weekends, I wasn't very ""involved"" in the Potterverse over the past decade.

Like many of you, I grew up with HP. The first book came out when I was starting elementary school, and ended when I was starting high school. I remember what a huge deal it was when the series ended - not just for me, but for millions of people worldwide. I read DH in a single sitting, and it was so bittersweet when it ended. It was a great ending to a legendary series, but of course, it was all over (minus the movies that had yet to come out, but those weren't as big of a deal) which was a very melancholy thing.

So anyways, I started my re-read this summer. I quickly looked forward to getting into bed every night like I used to when I was a kid and reading a few chapters before going to sleep. It felt so nostalgic. I have a couple random thoughts on things that I just wanted to say (that I'm sure are incredibly obvious and unoriginal to most of you, but whatever):

* I was *amazed* at how short the first two books are. Obviously I knew they were much shorter than the last few, but I don't think I realized just *how* short all those years ago. The first night I started reading Sorcerer's Stone, I got to 20% completed (reading on a kindle) in like... half an hour? Something insane. The sorting ceremony took place somewhere around the 40-50% mark, which blew my mind, since half the book was gone before Harry's first year even started or the plot really even got going.

* Maybe even more obvious, was difference in reading difficulty level from SS/CoS to PoA/GoF to the last three. I never realized it the first time (obviously because I was aging with the books), but the first couple are very seriously aimed at young kids. So much so that it made me hesitate when I first started the re-read. Of course, I knew it would pick up, but I didn't realize it was that ""basic"", for lack of a better word.

* Despite remembering the main plot points, I had forgotten so much of the series (much more than I thought) that I honestly felt excited to find out what happened next. Most of the small plot lines I had completely forgotten about, and made it feel like I was reading the series for the first time again. Things like, I completely forgot about Grawp.

* I felt and could relate to a lot more of the emotion in the latter books, particularly DH. Harry's subsequent walk to his death after the Prince's Tale and his inner monologue on the way there, as well as his use of the Resurrection Stone, really got me much more than it did ten years ago. I definitely don't think I appreciated how truly tragic and fucked up that situation was.

* I still don't see the hype for Luna as a character. She's obviously a really good person despite her quirks, but I still don't understand why people love her character so much. She's just kind of... there. I kind of dislike her (and her dad) more so than I did ten years ago because regardless of their good-intent, they're clearly nutjobs who and I think they deserve all the criticism they get from the characters in the book *and then* some. 

* I did a pretty radical 180 on Snape. I finished the series the first time with the feeling that Rowling wanted to me feel about him: *""What a brave, great man. He was good after all.""*. Now I just see a creep who acted like a dickhead. I think Rowling should have made his character arc and the reason he turned good more about how guilty he felt for his role in the Potters' death, rather than doing what he was doing mostly because he had some childhood crush on Lily that he still can't get over twenty years later.

I'm sure I have a lot more thoughts, but those are the main ones.

Anyways, now I just feel kinda empty, which is how I felt ten years ago. What a great series. I want to re-read again immediately, but I'm not going to. I think I'm going to wait another 5 to 10 years and do it again; I think this is a series I'll do a re-read of every 5 to 10 years for the rest of my life, in part so I can forget some of it and it be as magical as it was when I was a kid. I'm still several years away from wanting to have kids, but if I do, I can't wait to introduce to them to it.

I'm going to go watch the Fantastic Beasts movie now (which I still haven't seen), and then I will *consider* whether or not I want to read the Cursed Child script (which I've heard may not be a great idea).

I know none of you really care, and I'm sure you get posts like this on this sub all the time. I just felt the need to tell someone.

Having said that, it's completely sold out in London and receives rave reviews constantly.  Am I missing something?  Has anyone on the boards gone to see the show and THAT is the deciding factor?  As a fan of theater I can see how many the atmosphere and magic of live theater could help but gracious I never could understand the complete disconnect between camps!

Thoughts from both parties?  I know that it's a bit untimely to post about but it came up in an article I was reading that tickets are still impossible to get and it got me to thinking about this crazy disconnect again."

What would Molly Weasley's backstory be like?,"We know Molly Weasley is considered a pure blood and that she was sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. The only thing I remember of her stay at Hogwarts was that was where she met Arthur and that after a ""stroll"" with him, she was rebuked by the Fat Lady for returning to the Common Room at four in the morning.

I was surprised that Molly was able to single-handedly defeat Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of Hogwarts. We know Bellatrix was a powerful witch and would best be described as the most trusted and capable of Voldemort's followers. This made me think that she had some serious skills prior but had not used them for years. She was a mother and wife. Why would she need them? I could imagine that she was actually an accomplished dualist during her stint at Hogwarts, determined to make her mark on the Wizarding World. Then she met Arthur Weasley. After marriage the need to cast spells for battle was replaced by spells for housekeeping and cooking. So she may have been a little rusty, but still able to defeat Bellatrix.

Underappreciated character/Creature?,"Fawkes

So every time I watch or read Harry Potter I am reminded of just how awesome some of the secondary characters really are. Currently that is the case for Fawkes who is a total badass imo and I never totally realised that until now. Obviously the main case in point is the Phoenix helping Harry in the Chamber of Secrets by blinding the Basilisk and restoring Harry to full health. But Rowling writes the bird with such power and intelligence that I must have missed before. 

In summation for someone like Dumbledore who is seemingly amazing at everything and almost omniscient to have a companion, that friend will have to be equally awesome. Fawkes is really a great friend for Dumbledore (who is at times a bit reclusive despite being so warm and caring to people). I sort of see it as a parallel to Harry and Hedwig.

Contrived plot points because Harry is the main character of the books?,"Now I love the Harry Potter books but I think there are examples in the books of JKR giving Harry moments or positions within the book that feel extremely contrived and were only there because he was the main character and JKR wanted to make him really important.

Some examples I can think of

- Harry is instantly amazing at Quidditch, a sport he had never heard of months earlier, involving skills he had never used. He is instantly better than every other 1st year, despite a lot of other 1st years probably having ridden brooms all their lives. Natural talent does not trump practice like this.

- Harry is given a position on the Quidditch pitch where he is instantly the most important person on the field, so much so that no one else really matters, making Harry stand out even more. In fact all through the books, Harry never loses at Quidditch, and even when he loses, it is not because he was beaten by a better player, he always loses because of some outside factor that was not his fault.

- Harry being awarded a tonne of house points simply because Dumbledore felt like it, meaning Harry is responsible for Gryffindor winning the house trophy.

- Giving Harry the ability to fight off the imperius curse super easily, while everyone else really struggles, and not really offering up an explanation as to why Harry was instantly so much better than everyone else.

- Harry is instantly rich, despite not really doing anything for it.

- Harry gets given the best broom in the magical world, thus separating him further from everyone else.

- He is given the best magical core for his wand, and only very few people have the pheonix feather, and it is largely seen as the best.

- Harry through no real effort on his part somehow gets the girl, or Ginny sort of falls into his lap (figuratively).

- Harry is somehow a great teacher, for well, reasons.

- ALways told how amazing he is by those around him. A perfect example is the Patronus, where teachers and such are telling him what advanced magic it is, and how he is amazing for being able to do it while other students can't, forgetting the fact other students can't do it because they did not get the one on one teaching Harry got.

- His mother is literally the best person to ever walk the face of the earth.

- He never really gets called out on his mistakes. For instance, Harry got Hermione tortured, but it is never really mentioned after the fact.

Does anyone know where to find this? Harry Potter Colour Changing Candy,"Hello all

Maybe a strange question, and apologies if this isn't the appropriate subreddit.

Back in the early 2000s there was a type of official Harry Potter candy for sale that would change colour. Packaging was similar to the Harry Potter (same kind of purple), and in the same range they would sell the chocolate frogs as well (with the ""magic"" cards).

The candy itself was a hard candy (see through/slightly amber coloured), hollow in the middle, filled with some kind of powder. There was a weak point (by design) that would allow saliva to melt away the candy and react with the powder. The powder would then change colour while still in the hard shell, making the whole piece of candy appear a different colour. The taste of the hard candy was rather non-descript, but the powder was sour.

I don't remember seeing it ever since, and am in a nostalgic mood.

Does anyone know what I am talking about? If so, do you know if they are still available and where?

Thanks loads!

Edit to add: some colour differences were not as noticeable as others (blue and green was only a slight colour difference, but to red was big!).

Also, I am not sure if this is the right place for this to be posted, but here it is...

1) The Impact of Culture

In a hypothetical war between the muggles and wizards, we first need to consider each peoples' culture. Wizarding culture is, as far as I can tell, relatively stagnant. There is heavy regulation of new magic and the society, in general, has not seemed to change for a long time- magically, technologically or culturally. This does make sense on multiple fronts. The entire society, as far as we can tell, is educated in the same institution- something that does not promote much in the way of competition (often a key factor in cultural and technological change). Technology is rendered unusable by the fact that it simply does not behave itself around magic- how this works consistently with the laws of physics I don't think we should delve into. I also do not know if the reverse is true, but there is a consistent theme in Harry Potter of the fact that Wizards are simply less powerful than they used to be (the reason for which could be down to many factors.) Another point on the technology front is that so far, they really have no need for many of the technologies we have created to make our lives easier (because of Magic)- something that does not promote development. Another facet of the Wizarding culture that promotes stagnation that needs to be taken into account is the general aversion to Muggles and lack of knowledge of them, their culture, and their technology. The technology point has been covered, but the lack of cultural knowledge is strange. In my opinion, it is down to a lack of willingness to learn. Magical society in Harry Potter (at least until the events of the books and more than likely after, given how long it takes for the cultural zeitgeist to change in real life when deep beliefs are challenged) treats Muggles like second-class citizens, and more than likely based off this does not care to learn from them. This creates a stagnant society that, while it may be relatively stable, has some significant inbuilt disadvantages. It also includes a likely disgruntled populace who may work against it in the long run.

Muggle culture is definitely different, and much more malleable. We have become a society of early adopters, and are INCREDIBLY willing to adopt new technologies, in part down to the many global cultures (and yes I know this is a massive generalization), that tend to be relatively individualistic and competition based. This has created many issues in the past, but it does allow us to change quickly and adapt to new circumstances. It has also made us much more willing to fight and posture- something that could easily go towards raising tensions with Wizards, who do not seem to use these tactics as much. We are also quick to tribalism, and if we are attacked tend to want to respond with massive force. This works both ways- we are also more willing to attack that which we do not know. Now in comparison to Wizards, I believe Muggles will be more combative and willing to respond with force, but will also have more scientific curiosity and desire to know our enemy. After all, my belief is that Voldemort's biggest flaw was underestimation of Muggles and the expectation that we would just lay down and die- he honestly believed (as far as I can tell) that we were so far inferior to Wizards that we would see them as gods. 

2) The Tools of War

Wizard battle on a large scale seems incredibly akin to World War One-style combat. The evidence we have to go off of large-scale war is from Book 7/ Movies 7 and 8, where the attack on Hogwarts seems to mainly consist of a human wave attack with large creature support (like trolls and giants). This is an effective strategy mainly through luck. There simply were not enough defenders in Hogwarts to illuminate this as the tactical mistake that it really is. It is also telling here that they do not simply apparate into the castle (I do not know if it has defenses for that), but if it does not, then the reason logically is that it is a very, very difficult and dangerous spell to perform. Combat apparations, in my opinion, would have a 60/40 split of successful apparations and horrific mutilations. Tangent aside, the WW1-style tactics also make sense for a civilization that has not seen a major battle based war for years. Wizard wars seem like they tend to be brushfire conflict, much of which goes on behind the scenes with terror attacks abounding. Wizard wars seem to be more like police actions, and it shows in their society with much more emphasis being placed on Aurors etc instead of 'real' armies.

Muggle warfare is...different. It is informed by thousands of years of butchery and has evolved to a horrifically efficient form. The sheer shock and awe a modern military can deploy are shocking- you simply need to look to those who have been on the receiving end of a hail of automatic gunfire, much less a heavy artillery bombardment. (My grandfather was a transport pilot in World War Two and had to fly through flak 'as thick as fog'- he described it as hell.) Hence the reason our soldiers are so well trained nowadays- the level of self-control necessary is extremely intense. Ultimately, the act of trying to 'fire' spells under this form of bombardment would be an incredibly difficult skill, especially since spells are not only heavily linked to emotion, but also are case specific. Instead of simply pulling a trigger, you need to think of the right spell to use in that specific tactical situation and muster the emotion necessary to fire. This allows for an incredible amount of tactical flexibility, but at the cost of intense, borderline inhuman levels of self-control.

We also need to examine, beyond just the tactics and effectiveness of weapons, how the two combat forms interact. Standing at 100 meters and given the order to kill each other, an infantryman would more than likely win a duel against a wizard- all he needs to do is point and fire. An automatic rifleman or machine gunner doubly so. We also do not know if armor would block spells- after all, the killing curse is stopped by solid objects. Would it be stopped by a SAPI plate or more extremely Chobham armor? We also do not know if there are kinetic impact shield spells- protego protects from other spells, but I am not sure if it does from a rifle round. There is also the fact that bullets essentially travel faster than thought. The world's fastest reflexes have been measured at 17m/s, while a 7.62mm round has a muzzle velocity of 61m/s. Wizard spells again, however, are more tactically flexible and allow for a single soldier to have an incredible number of roles. We also need to consider how the people would react to each other- would the Muggles be able to build magic detectors? Presumably so, given the fact that Magic messes with EM forces. 

3) Conflict

In my opinion, there are two ways a war would break out. 

One is the 'Voldemort/pure-blood invasion' scenario.

Voldemort wins the final battle, with a small resistance force of DA escaping the castle, hunted by death eaters. I believe that Voldemort underestimates the muggles too much to utilize mind control much in his takeover- it more than likely would be marching into the PM's office, and declaring himself in charge, with Death Eaters in the streets butchering people for fun and profit. If I was a Muggle commander at this point, I would bring in the forces I could and make a show of gathering somewhere- baiting the enemy into open battle and utilising air assets as well as things like Light Anti-Air Defense Vehicles (armored vehicles with incredibly fast firing guns) to destroy as many enemy assets as possible. Speed and area of effect would be our friends here. While in-universe a commander would more than likely not take this route, instead of beginning with tester attacks to determine enemy strength, I believe it would be a viable tactic to destroy much of the enemy force in decapitation strikes. The surviving DA could also be useful for a decapitation strike- if they were rescued, then they would know locations that could be scheduled for demolition in decapitation strikes. 

This format of war would, I believe, end in the death/destruction of Voldemort, and a new government is installed with the wizards. The death eaters, it has been shown, fracture without a central command structure, and if Voldemort and his inner cabal were terminated or incapacitated, then his forces would more than likely surrender (especially if the remaining DA members made themselves known to governments.)

The other type is less clear-cut, and it is the cold war scenario.

Wizardkind is unambiguously and publicly revealed to the Muggles. Tensions build as the Muggles feel threatened as well as the Wizards. Eventually, either they live together and integrate, or something sparks. If so, then the war is more akin to ethnic violence. It involves literal witch hunts, executions, terror attacks, mind control and racist organizations- the KKK and death eaters have parallels after all. This is less clear-cut, and while I believe the Muggles would, simply through numbers, 'win', there would be no clear-cut sides, and it would very likely result in the mutual destruction of both Wizards and humans- perhaps even via nuclear war between 'pro Wizard' and 'anti Wizard' countries.

So if you have read this far, I offer serious congratulations. My ramblings have so far been long, tedious and well...rambly. Thanks so much for reading and if you feel like it, I'd absolutely love to hear your comments and ideas- if this provokes discussion I will consider it a job well done. 

Thanks again so much dear redditor, and I look forward to your thoughts.

Stephen Fry vs. Jim Dale,"Which do you prefer?

When I was a kid me and my family used to go on long road-trips (crossing the whole of Europe sometimes), and would therefore listen to the Harry Potter books read by Stephen Fry on casette in the car. I've always loved them, and listening to PS and CoS on casette was my first introduction in HP in the 90s. 

Recently I decided to check out Jim Dale's version, as I've seen it mentioned on here a few times. I'm absolutely hating it, and can't see getting past the first few chapters. So for me obviously Fry wins by a clear margin. I'm sure that I am kind of biased, but even if I try to look at it objectively I find Stephen Fry to be *vastly* superior.

Why did Hermione decide that Ron's comment on saving House Elves was the final straw in holding back her feelings for him?,"&gt;‚ÄúHang on a moment!‚Äù said Ron sharply. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve forgotten
someone!‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúWho?‚Äù asked Hermione.

&gt;‚ÄúThe house-elves, they‚Äôll all be down in the kitchen, won‚Äôt
they?‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúYou mean we ought to get them fighting?‚Äù asked Harry.

&gt;‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Ron seriously, ‚ÄúI mean we should tell them to get
out. We don‚Äôt want anymore Dobbies, do we? We can‚Äôt order them
to die for us‚Äî‚Äú

&gt;There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione‚Äôs
arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck
and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and
broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm
that he lifted Hermione o‚Üµ her feet.

&gt;‚ÄúIs this the moment?‚Äù Harry asked weakly, and when nothing
happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still
more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. ‚ÄúOi!
There‚Äôs a war going on here!‚Äù

&gt;Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each
other.

&gt;‚ÄúI know, mate,‚Äù said Ron, who looked as though he had recently
been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs now or
never, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúNever mind that, what about the Horcrux?‚Äù Harry shouted.

&gt;‚ÄúD‚Äôyou think you could just‚Äîjust hold it in until we‚Äôve got the
diadem?‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúYeah‚Äîright‚Äîsorry‚Äî‚Äù said Ron, and he and Hermione set
about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.

So there is the scene in question, and I am sure you are all aware of it. My question though, is why was Ron's comment here what triggered Hermione to throw all caution to the wind and kiss Ron like she had wanted to kiss him for years? Why was it this moment, and not another, and what do you think Hermione was thinking the moment Ron said it?

For me I honestly can't decide, and I think there are two possibilities. The first one is that simply hearing Ron being so compassionate was for Hermione the final straw (in a positive way) and that in that second, she knew Ron was worth the huge risk she was taking in kissing him.

The second one is similar but a little different as Hermione's work with SPEW, Ron was always in theory agreeing with her but at the same time he saw the house elves as happy to serve. Ron's comment above showed that he had become in that moment a lot more open minded, and very willing to change his opinion (not something a lot of people do actually) and for Hermione, him finally taking to heart something that she found so important, was the final straw, and that seeing Ron change his opinion, to become more open minded convinced Hermione to hell with the risks, and she was going to kiss him and show him in that one kiss everything he meant to her, because in that moment she had never loved him more.

My problem with SPEW,"For some reason, a lot of people see Hermione's act of trying to campaign for the freeing of house-elves as a good thing. I don't quite see it that way. I see what she is doing more as how in olden times, imperialists ""educated"" their subjects, forcing them to give up their way of life and their passions to become ""Christianized"" and such.

Firstly, Hermione is an outsider with absolutely no knowledge of House-elf customs or traditions. Due to her lack of understanding, she has very little idea of what the House-elves are like.

Secondly, she forces her beliefs onto the house-elves whether they like it or not, and just assumes that she is doing the right thing by hiding the socks around the Gryffindor Common Room. She isn't giving the house-elves a choice - she just insists on trying to set them free.

Thirdly, and most importantly, she just doesn't listen to the house-elves, the ones she is actually trying to help. This demonstrates a kind of arrogance, assuming that she knows better what the houselves want than themselves.

Basically, to cut a Long story short, what Hermione did with SPEW wasn't the right thing. It would have been much better to campaign against the unfair treatment of houseelves  than trying to set them all free, and, because of her actions, she acted kinda like the imperialists of olden times.

End Credits of Half-Blood Prince,"Sorry in advance if this has already been discussed.
So I was watching Half-Blood Prince for the millionth time, and, like I always do, I noticed the music in the end credits of Half-Blood Prince are quite... joyful. It just seemed too uplifting despite what had just happened (Dumbledore's very sad death) and what was to come in the Deathly Hallows series. It was like they decided ""lets lighten the mood a bit with this music"", but it actually ruins the movie a little bit for me. I know I am sounding nitpicky but the score is a massive addition to any movie, and the dark tone of the film did not match themes and events of the movie AT ALL. Was anyone else put off by this?

PS. still an awesome movie!",0,"End Credits of Half-Blood Prince Sorry in advance if this has already been discussed.

I finished Harry Potter book series!!!,"So my brothers and sister are big Harry Potter fans, and me being the youngest one always hated Harry Potter because (according to little me) it was too mainstream. I watched most of the movies and I felt pretty bored and thought it wasn‚Äôt making any sense, and just unnecessarily dark. Anyway, a few months ago I bought audiobooks read by Jim Dale and immediately fell in love with the book. From the first to the last it was just beautiful, so beautifully written and with such detail. I think the movies are great too, once I rewatched it after the books. 
The one thing that really fascinated me in the book was the way J.K Rowling made Harry Potter so relatable to being real life. For example the way Rowling described how he felt, what he thought and what he was like, all making him exactly what we would‚Äôve been if we were him, like for example if Harry does something awkward, the way Rowling describes his feelings, it is almost exactly the same as you would‚Äôve felt given the same situation. Most books , movies characters fail to achieve this type of connection. It‚Äôs incredible how she made the magical world seem so normal and it feels you‚Äôre in there. 

I do regret being that edgy kid to be honest, who never liked Harry Potter and only judged on movies. One of the reason of my regret is also that I barely get to use my own imagination. This is I envy all old Harry Potter fans. Like Harry Potter was exactly what Dan Radcliffe was in the movies. I really wanted to know the difference between muggle clothes and wizards clothes, like the book made it seem like there were big differences between the muggles and wizards way of living, but the movies didn‚Äôt do a good job differentiating them apart, but oh well Harry Potter world is beautiful in itself!!

House elves and child-rearing,"I've been thinking lately about what role house-elves play in raising their masters' children. I think it must be significant, since in lots of wealthy families the servants spend more time with the children than their parents do. 

This has me thinking about the relationships between Draco and Dobby, Kreacher and Sirius/Regulus, and Winky and Barty Crouch Jr. Sure, the house-elves were just following orders from their masters, and the Malfoys especially probably didn't want Dobby having too much influence over Draco. But I also found it rather hard to believe that Dobby wasn't more upset over what Draco became, and that Draco wasn't more upset/jealous over losing Dobby. 

The dynamic between Kreacher and the Black brothers disturbs me even more. For all that Kreacher was a product of his environment, Kreacher helped shape Sirius' environment and called him a traitor when he lashed out. Kreacher had a hand in raising two boys and he was the reason both of them died young. It's even worse when you realize that Kreacher was ~600 years old (according to Rowling) and Regulus was 18.

Re-reading the series as an adult and realizing how shitty Fudge is.,"So I just finished the fourth book, and the way Fudge completely disregards the facts at the end of the story and how Molly reacts with how Arthur never got far in the Ministry because he didn't have ""proper wizard pride"" just really hits me that Fudge isn't a great person. I thought of him the way Harry had, in a bumbling benevolent sort of way. It's only as an adult you see those nuances of adult dickish behavior. 
And with the current political climate in the U.S., it just hits me how similarly Fudge and Trump behave. Both skew the media to tell the story they want, and focus on ""other"" matters so they don't have to deal with the big, important problems at hand. 
Anyway, just my 2 cents. :)

Looking for some specific fan-fic,"It's been years, so I honestly can't remember, but I believe it starts after the third or fourth book? These are the key points that I remember...



One ""book"" follows Arthur and his family to Egypt where they tour the pyramids.  For some reason, Harry and Hermione are there.



The next ""book"". Harry asks Cho on a date, and she agrees. Turns out, Cho is into bloodsport, and takes Harry to an underground gladiator arena where wizards are pitted against dragons and such.



Another ""book"". Harry, Hermione and Ron are all animagus? animagi? animagusses? whatever. Neville is a deatheater.  There's a kind of combat game during DAtDA. Draco dates Ginny and turns out to be a good guy?



Idk, I'm pretty drunk, so a lot of the details may be mixed, or entirely made up. I'm fairly certain I read some fanfic with these plot points within the last decade? If any of this is, in any way, familiar to anyone, I would appreciate a remembral in the right direction. Thanks!

"I already own the US hardcover editions of the series, should I get the kindle set as well?","I read the Harry Potter series as a child and fell in love with the Wizarding World. Also went to the midnight releases for the movies as well. I know the movies by heart since Freeform plays them almost every weekend. Good background noise, right? I currently own the US hardcover editions and they sit on a shelf at my Dad's.

 Over the past two weeks, I've had the urge to reread the series. I usually can't reread a book since I already know what's going to happen. On the other hand, I haven't tried to reread them since the last book came out. The books have so much more story than the movies. I don't want to carry each copy around in my purse and damage the covers. I also like the idea of having the whole series just right there on my kindle.

Does anyone else think it‚Äôs really weird that they celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts? Wouldn‚Äôt they just see Jesus as a fellow wizard?,"Well, on that note, here‚Äôs my headcanon history of the Wizarding World.

Long ago, Wizards and Muggles lived together in society. Wizards and witches, a tiny fraction of the general population, generally made up the elites of society, serving as god-kings, oracles, soothsayers, court magicians, and regional demi-gods in the polytheistic societies of the ancient era. Then, everything changed when the most powerful wizard of all time, Jesus Christ, created a stone that could resurrect people from the dead and a stone that could grant eternal life. Immediately, everyone had utopian dreams of a world where the last enemy, death, was defeated for all.

But some wizards and witches realized that this would quickly lead to mass overpopulation. To avoid this grim future, they decided that only a master race, magical folk like them, were deserving of eternal life. To avoid a mass Muggle revolution against them, they decided to strike first, with the aim of killing all Muggles to depopulate the planet.

These wizards confidently believed that they would easily overpower the pathetic Muggles in a quick war. And at times they were largely successful, swiftly killing millions upon millions of Muggles in events such as what is now known today as the plague of Justinian. But the Muggles had a few tricks up their sleeves, such as:

1.	Outnumbering wizards and witches 10,000 to 1

2.	Muggle-born wizards and witches, who had a habit of siding with their Muggle families and community. They could point out the locations of hidden wizards and witches, allowing Muggles to hunt them down, identify magic, and save their Muggle friends from dangerous spells and potions. This is the origin of anti-‚ÄúMudblood‚Äù hatred in the Wizarding World today.

Finally, around the time of the Middle Ages, it became extremely clear that the war was lost for Wizarding kind. To ensure they weren‚Äôt entirely annihilated as a people, the few remaining witches and wizards formed a hidden separatist state within Muggle society, and worked tirelessly to Obliviate all Muggles so they would believe that magic was a myth.

This Ministry of Magic was terrified that Muggles might find out about them one day, so they made preserving secrecy from Muggles at large their number one priority. They created all sorts of propaganda to ensure that wizards wouldn‚Äôt stick their noses in Muggle society:

1.	Wizarding supremacists could never admit that Muggles outsmarted and overpowered them. So the Wizarding World adopted and extreme ethnocentric viewpoint, arguing that Muggles were dumb, worthless apes not worth a wizard or witch‚Äôs time. One should not harm a Muggle for the same reason one should not kick a dog.

2.	Those that expressed an ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù curiosity towards Muggles were seen as weirdos and societal outcasts. There is no reason anyone should be poor in the Wizarding World, but Arthur Weasley was. The message? Don‚Äôt think too much about the Muggles.

3.	Extreme ignorance of Muggle society was encouraged. Again, Arthur Weasley, the pureblood wizard who knew the most about Muggles, still couldn‚Äôt grasp basic facts about the Muggle world.

4.	Technology was largely frozen at Middle Ages levels. Too much Muggle technology might make witches and wizards curious about their Muggle neighbors.

5.	A death cult was created. The secret for how to create the eternal life and resurrection stones was lost in the war, along with the last Resurrection Stone, and the last Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone was closely guarded by the Ministry. To convince witches and wizards to not try to rediscover this power, the Ministry started making absurd arguments like, ‚ÄúTo the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.‚Äù

But the major reason the Ministry existed as long as it has, the keystone of their power, is:

6.	The liberal use of Azkaban, a torture camp much worse than death. Any wizard or witch who toed the line would immediately be taken to Azkaban, even if the evidence against them was flimsy. This created a climate of terror, as magical folks were extremely unwilling to ever mess with any of the Ministry‚Äôs absurd laws.

Of course, not all wizards blindly accepted the Ministry‚Äôs rule. A few wizards still dreamed of following their ancestors and devouring death. These Death Eaters were committed to defeating the Ministry and the Muggleborns, reigniting the war against the Muggles, and rediscovering the cure for death.

Why is Peter considered a Weak Wizard?,"Peter is a weak person, no one can argue with that... but weak Wizard? Not really.. 

He is an animagus, something that takes a vast level of power and skill. 

He can cast wordless magic, a mark of magical superiority. 

He can cast the death curse- a mark of power

He outsmarted Sirius easily, framing him for the murder of a bunch of muggle- Conniving but deeply intelligent...

He hid with the Weasley's, giving him food, protection and access to the Wizarding world- If nothing else that is strategic and brilliant... 

He helped make the potion and perform the ritual that revived Voldemort- That shows skills in potions and the ability to remember strict instructions...

Moony - transformation,"As a werewolf, Lupin transforms every month during the full moon. As a child he was whisked away to the shrieking shack, and as an adult he hides or takes the wolf's bane potion. The potion allows him to keep his mind while he's transformed, and he can curl up in his office.  

On the night that worm tail escaped, its night when they're in the shack. It is night time. The last rays of the setting sun are visible before Sirius takes Ron into the whomping willow (pg 332). And the trio doesn't come back out of the shack for over an hour (pg 408). That's not counting the few minute here and there between Lupin/Snape/Hagrid coming into and out of the scene. So it is safe to say that they are in the shack for an hour and a quarter at least. It is full on nighttime. But Lupin is able to walk the grounds until the clouds shift and reveal the full moon. Implying that the moon has to be visible to the werewolf in order for the transformation to occur. Why not just have a windowless room?  Put his office in the dungeons. It seems to me that based on this very specific requirement, it would be easy to not transform each month.

Thing about Filch I thought up,"Filch going on a date with Madam Pince, but having the Weasley twins as backup to cause trouble in case it starts going badly so he can leave.

The twins start causing trouble anyway but it backfires as they never returned a book three years ago and Pince is mad about it, so they spend the date chasing the twins down with Filch's shortcut knowledge and Pince's nasty jinx abilities.

Luna Lovegood is the cure to Voldemort and all Bigotry,"Despite being quirky and weird, Luna was not weak or dumb. She was exceptionally intelligent with a talent for Charms ( she spelled a Lion hat to roar and a Eagle to Flap it's wings). She is a skilled fighter, suriving battles that decimated aurors and experianced fighters. Yet, she didn't have arrogance or cruelty inside of her. 

She was bullied by most of Hogwarts, she lost her mom and her dad was nuts but still she was filled with Love, respect and kindness. She didn't hate people or lash out in anger... 

Luna had one flaw though, she was too passive. She let people unleash all sorts of abuse on her without any reactions... that is kind of a problem... but other then that, she was perfect and I love her.

Harry lost a day?,"Im a lifelong fan, read the books hundreds of times, I should be fairly clued in by now. However, I started reading the philosophers stone again and realised that in the first chapter, where vernon dursley is at work and sees the wizard celebrating the demise of Voldemort and spots cat Minerva on the wall reading a map and hears about shooting stars on the news all happens on the day after Voldemort dies, but Harry doesn't get dropped off on the doorstep until the day after that, so where was Harry during this time? It wouldn't take hagrid a full day to fly from godrics hollow to privet drive so where were they? It's not exactly important I know but I am curious.

Slytherin house and how it is perceived,"These are some thoughts I had while trying to decide what my own Hogwarts house would be. Lots of people tend to see the Slytherin house as evil, or least dark. Not in the most obvious ways, too. Those random 'slytherin aesthetic' posts you find on Pinterest are a great example of that. They're always mildly creepy and admittedly while I *like* that aesthetic, that's not what I think Slytherin is about.

Resourcefulness, cunning, ambition, determination, self-preservation, fraternity, cleverness. These are the traits, and none of them point to 'evil'. The ony ones that even hint at it are 'self-preservation' and 'cunning', and if they're used in the right way they would cause no harm at all. Humanity would be nowhere without its ambitious, resourceful people. 

People in this fandom judge Slytherin by what it was in its worst era, what it was when witches and wizards were being persecuted, and what it was when Voldemort was still around. One thing that I *can* say about its traits is that they might be the ones most easily drawn to dark magic, to the dark side- for either power or self-preversation. During those times the chances of that happening were very high, and the most suscpetible people were affected by that. 

But judging Slytherin by this is simply unfair. Voldemort is now gone, and the Slytherin traits should now be able to flourish without having to bear the burden of being linked to him. It is a different house now, that much we can learn from The Cursed Child (which I reluctantly accept as canon). Harry Potter's own son is a Slytherin, so is Scorpius and neither is by a long shot a bad kid. 

My bottom line is that I think the people who identify with the Slytherin house should be able to enjoy expressing that without concerning themselves with what their house was like in the past. It should be nothing more or less than something to learn from and never repeat.

Another book detail,"For all the small inconsistencies you can find in the HP world, it's also cool how internally consistent they are from book to book.

In the first chapter of the Philosopher's Stone, I thought it was a little odd that Dumbledore would use what seems to be the fairly inconvenient Deluminator to cut the lights when, prodigious wizard as he was, he could have done the same thing much more quickly and easily with a wave of his wand.

Then I noticed that during that entire time, with McGonagall and Dumbledore and even Hagrid, that all the displays of magic on that street (with the possible exception of apparating) were done without a wand at all.

Then I thought about the trace on Harry (now that he's outside his parent's Fidelious Charm), and the fact that if Voldemort had control over the Ministry when he returned later then he likely would at least have spies in the Ministry before, and there were no other wizards in Privet Drive (confirmed by Fudge later).  The trace would trigger on any spell casting, but doesn't trigger for the use of enchanted objects. (Monster book of Hagrid's, sneakoscopes, chocolate frogs, etc.)

So perhaps they were avoiding magic so as not to give any remaining Death Eaters a way to trace Harry's whereabouts. Being worried about that, it makes sense, and is quite convenient, that Dumbledore used the Deluminator that night.",0,"Another book detail For all the small inconsistencies you can find in the HP world, it's also cool how internally consistent they are from book to book.

Thoughts on WatchMojo's Top 10 Harry Potter Characters ranking?,"For reference, here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biNkIUrtR2g

I don't necessarily agree with Snape being #1, but I do admire at least the idea of giving the top spot to someone other than the obvious title character based on character development; IMO Dumbledore could also be considered #1 based on similar criteria.

As for the other choices, I'd say that Sirius (#4) is *way* too high here - Ron, Hermione and Voldemort should all be ahead of him - and that Draco Malfoy should have been *at least* an honorable mention.",0,"Thoughts on WatchMojo's Top 10 Harry Potter Characters ranking?

About Neville's Boggart,"Does nobody realize that Neville was thirteen (my english teacher was my greatest fear at that age) and *also* mentioned his grandmother was also another choice of boggart? Neville's actual quote: *""But I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either!""*

Also, Snape had been in the room a minute before and had delivered a scathing remark pointed at Neville.


I feel like people put too much stock in the boggart thing than necessary. Also these boggarts were all set up to be a contrast to Harry's own boggart that was a dementor, to represent fear itself.


You cannot convince me that Neville's *legitimate* worst fear is Snape, when he has parents that were tortured to insanity. I imagine if Neville had met Bellatrix prior to the boggart session, she would be stepping out of the wardrobe.


And besides, do we even actually get any true instances of actual trauma caused by Snape [sans  Dumbledore's death and events after](/spoiler). Sure, he insults Hermione's teeth and she cries due to the incredibly stressful and physically painful situation, but Hermione is smiling when we next see her and says that she was wanting to have her teeth resized anyway, and this gave her an excuse to do so. 

Students, as shown in both the books and movies, completely brush off his comments or get mad about them, stay mad for a little while, then just forget about it as they're *merely remarks from a mean, strict teacher*. Does that make Snape's words appropriate? Hell no. But as someone who has been abused, and been subjected to mean teachers who have done far worse things to me and my classmates than Snape ever does, I think I can definitely tell the difference between trauma and mean comments from a teacher.


People also really, really tend to discount Neville and Hermione when it comes to Snape. Sure, Neville's boggart was him, but we can see above that I highly doubt it's caused by real trauma and not the representation of a childish fear, written into the chapter in the first place as a foil to Harry's own very serious fears, as well as a spot of humor in PoA. 


I'd also like to mention, McGonagall herself is also shown being mean to Neville, albeit not to the same level as Snape. In the same book she refuses to allow Neville to know any of the passwords as punishment for listing down the passwords to remember. Neville was camping outside the common room waiting for someone to let him in, for crying out loud. 

So, yes. If we're going to continue the Endless Snape Debate, can we please stop using this as a copy-paste ""Boom, gotcha!"" argument? ",0,"About Neville's Boggart Does nobody realize that Neville was thirteen (my english teacher was my greatest fear at that age) and *also* mentioned his grandmother was also another choice of boggart? Neville's actual quote: *""But I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either!""*

Also, Snape had been in the room a minute before and had delivered a scathing remark pointed at Neville.


I feel like people put too much stock in the boggart thing than necessary. Also these boggarts were all set up to be a contrast to Harry's own boggart that was a dementor, to represent fear itself.

Remus and the Boggart,"I've recently finished reading the books for the first time and have begun to re-watch the movies for like the 4th time. Something I never noticed but have since reading the books is what the Boggart turns into for Remus.

But the books give so much detail into what Remus fears most in life, which is also pointed out in the Deathly Hallows after Remus and Tonks get married/gets pregnant.

Have you ever converted a friend?,"As luck would have it, two of my closest friends aren't into HP at all.

Voldemort and Nagini,"Today my cousin was sharing her experience of an orphanage visit. She saw many babies who rarely cried unlike normal babies. She asked their caretaker how did they manage it(she thought they had some different approach to childcare that made children so content). But that lady callously replied that they do not cry often because they know that crying will not get them anything and others who cry like normal babies are spoiled brats 

Doesn't Mrs. Cole say that Tom Riddle too did not cry much as a baby?I suddenly remembered this groatesque picture.

Hogwarts &amp; MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator),"Greetings,

* Before you begin reading the rest of this text-post, I thought I would let you know that this is in fact my second time posting this article, as I did not receive enough replies last time, to create an accurate source of information.  

An intriguing thought has been circling my mind the past few weeks in relation to MBTI and Hogwarts Houses, and whether or not one particular house carries many students of a certain personality type.

In case you are unaware of what MBTI or commonly known as Myers Briggs is, it is a personality type indicator. By taking a twelve minute quiz, you are placed into one of sixteen personality types that represent your answers. The types are made up of the following...
Introversion vs Extraversion
Sensing vs Intuition
Thinking vs Feeling
Judging vs Prospecting

Each personality type has a detailed description on one's way of perception and way of living.
If you have never found your personality type, a fairly accurate free quizz is placed below.

Once you have found your identified type, you may transfer your answers onto a Google Form I have created linked below.

Once I have received 200 hundred replies I will calculate results and place them on a pie graph which will be posted as a new text post.

My favorite thing about Harry Potter,"The Masks everyone wears... I just love them. No one is purely good or bad, no matter what mask they show to the world. The Good characters have laws and the Bad had positive traits, it is so much more then most Stories ever bother to show ( You may have Notice I explained more here, well some people can't tell the difference between a Post stating what I like over a possible trolling... so I have to be more specific) 

Snape is a monster regardless, but he is a monster with a complex past. Dumbledore isn't a kind old man like we thought, but a manipulative Machiavellian figure who enjoyed controlling others and playing chess with the Lives of all those around him... he had no sense of mercy, boundaries or  morals. 

Hermione wasn't obsessed with obedience, she was a social warrior and utterly ruthless capable of almost any kind of dark deed.  she would kill a million to save the world, something Harry and Ron lacked. 

Ron wasn;t a jealous lazy twit, he was an emotionally abused boy stuck in poverty with an emotionally neglectful/abusive mother and a shocking talent for strategy that rivaled Dumbledores ( Or it could have if given the right circumstance and experiance). 

Sirius wasn't a Carefree prankster, he was a bully and bigot ( towards house elves to some degree) and was kind of an ass but with his heart in the right place most of the time. 

Remus wasn't emotionally abused for bieng a werewolf, he was a weak man with a million excuses and an inability to realize that being a wolf wasn't the end of the world. He had a happy child hood but let go of all connections after James died and Sirius was imprisoned.. ( JK rowling confirmed as much) 

Peter wasn't a weak or stupid wizard, he was a predatory coward with shocking skill in magic. He wasnt without morals,he just chose not to tap into them.... 

Molly wasn't a loving overworked mother.... she was emotionally controlling, abusive and neglectful. She turned her kids against each other and squashed their independence and dreams. She was ruthlessly cruel to Fleur ( the Ideal daughter in law, Loving, compassionate, intelligent, Kind, Powerful, Skilled and of course gorgeous) for literally no reason. She chose to listen to gossip over Hermione, whom she already knew very well at that point... she was waspish and treated children like headcases despite Harry and co being far more capable then all of the Order put together and having done more for the fight against Voldie then all of the Order put together. She isolated her kids, which was why two lived out of the country, one left the family all together and two were Fred and George ( total rebels who surpassed her abuse to make something of themselves)... Ron was the one who got hit with the neglect the hardest. Percy was spoiled over his siblings...which makes his leaving make sense.

Percy wasn't a weak man, he was a logical ambitious boy overtaken by the possibility to make his dreams become a reality. His family stopped supporting him in place of Harry whom Percy had no reason to trust ( he didn't really know Harry) and he had a hundred reasons to distrust Dumbles including Sirius breaking in and Ginny almost dying. He was bullied mercilessly by his brothers. he chose to have faith in hsi goverment, which he had never seen be corrupt personally ( his dad worked for them and it was his ambition to work for them)... he was an interesting person with a lot to give but the world shat on him...

The darkest time line in Cursed Child could have made for a really interesting setting for a spin off,"I really believe that the time line  caused by Albus and Scorpius in CC where Voldemort has won could have been more interesting than just ""Hey check out this character. Member?"" I'm imagining muggles and muggle borns having been exterminated in this time line. They mention they have some jailed in the Hogwarts dungeon and I imagine that when they capture survivors living off the grid, they keep some for target practice/experiments. I could see muggle born witches and wizards being the guards for groups of muggles traveling great distances. Almost like an Underground Railroad sort of vibe.  There is a story there that would have really interested me. Seeing these last remaining wizards who aren't pure blood fanatics try to survive in a dystopian wizarding world would have been intriguing.  Idk how it would have been done, if it would have been different in that when Albus and Scorpius end up in this alternate universe, They lose the time turner and have to go on a journey and grow attached to this group of survivors. Maybe Albus or Scorpius develops a romance with one of them, and they feel a responsibility to ensure their safety in case they are unable to retrieve the time turner and stop this all from happening. I feel a really human story like that would have raised the stakes, because now it's not just ""We f'd the time line so let's play a game of member berrys with characters who are dead and then change everything back without any reason for the audience to really care."" Now it's ""we've screwed the time line Barry Allen style,  and now these people who are being hunted for extermination by dark wizards are our responsibility, us, two 14 year old wizards who don't really know what we're doing. We have to make sure these people are safe while also trying to stop any of this from ever happening because we are the ones that erased our own parents from existence and brought back the most evil dark wizard to have ever lived. And it's fully possible we will fail because we have absolutely no means of undoing any of this, which is why we owe it to these people to make sure they at least will live.""  Now suddenly the story has some gravitas, some emotion. A really good writer could have had us grown attached to these AU characters who we sadly won't get to see again since (at least some) might not even exist in the original time line.

Now suddenly the story has some gravitas, some emotion. A really good writer could have had us grown attached to these AU characters who we sadly won't get to see again since (at least some) might not even exist in the original time line. Would have been one hell of a way to teach Albus what life was really like for his old man. "
Gender swap in Harry Potter,"I was thinking about this today! 

Which character would you most like to see as the opposite gender? And would it have been as successful?

I think that would be a very interesting read! And it would defiantly change the power dynamics of the books if certain characters were changed! I would personally love to see a female Voldemort or Snape! And maybe a male Mcgonagal! I'm not sure that Voldemort as a woman would of had the same fear associated with it though (not that women can't be incredible villains, look at Bellatrix Lestrange)

Are the adult editions/bloomsbury editions of the books discontinued? Can't find them anywhere...,"Hello there! 

I'm in absolute love with the hardback adult editions of the books with the black covers and finally have enough money to get them. However, I can't actually find them anywhere?? Are they out of print?? 

Does anyone know where i can find them? I'd prefer to get them new but if pre-owned is the only option left then i'm down with that too. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Signups for October Werewolves are now live!,"#What is Werewolf?

HogwartsWerewolves is a game similar to Mafia/Ultimate Werewolf but played on an internet forum. A new game is hosted each month by a variety of game facilitators. Sign ups open on the 25th of each preceding month. New players cannot join a game once it starts, but have to wait for the following month. The theme, roles, and gameplay may vary each month as the facilitator chooses, but the premise remains the same: an evil team attacks the good team at night and the good team tries to lynch evil team members during the day. Only living players can actively participate in the game threads. There is an accompanying private subreddit, /r/HogwartsGhosts, that players are added to as they die to freely discuss the game.

#Where and how is this played?

Each month at /r/HogwartsWerewolves, a new game is ran by a new set of hosts. This month is a *double month,* which means that there are two games to choose from! Both setups promise innovation and uncharted events. 
 
Game A is [Alpine Terror](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/727voh/alpine_terror_rules_and_roles/) by /u/MacabreGoblin, /u/oomps62, and /u/Moostronus

Game B is [Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria](https://www.reddit.com/r/HogwartsWerewolves/comments/727vhq/game_xb_2017_freddy_fazbears_pizzeria_roles_rules/) by /u/funkimon

Love heals all Wounds?,"(Not Slash in any way)When Voldemort's soul fragment burrowed into Harry, He gained characteristics of the man like resourcefulness and Parsletongue... but what if the opposite was also true?

Unused to the Sensation of guilt, it begins to teach Harry to Kill it's tiny fragment ( since the Current Voldemort is .78 of an actual soul since each Horcrux divides the soul by half) to make up for it's past and clean the slate on Voldemort.

Best and Worst Harry Potter video games?,"If we're going to be judging by each of the seven installments as a whole, then Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone *easily* takes the cake by virtue of the fact that it is actually *five* completely different games across various platforms (PS1, PC, PS2, GBA and GBC). Based on my memory, the PS2 game was probably the best of them. The GBC game, which was a turn-based RPG, was pretty entertaining as well, and the Chamber of Secrets game on the same platform was just like it, though I never played it.

**EDIT:** The Lego games are great as well; sorry for forgetting about them.

As for the worst ones, I distinctly remember OotP (on Wii) being boring AF compared to the Stone games, of which I'd played all of as a younger kid, due to the fact that *no new action sequences were added to the story for the sake of fleshing out gameplay*. Most of the whole game consisted of running around Hogwarts doing mundane tasks; there were no monsters to fight or anything like in the previous games. From what I've heard, the Half-Blood Prince game was much like this too, and the Deathly Hallows games sucked as well, at least according to Angry Joe.
I also played the Quidditch World Cup game as a kid, and remember it being so easy that I effortlessly won every single game by a landslide, *even without catching the Snitch*.",0,"Best and Worst Harry Potter video games?

Dumbledore's watch,"Just started another reread of the series, and in the very first chapter I saw a description of Dumbledore's watch that I had never noticed before. He pulls out a 'golden watch' to check the time when he's talking with McGonagall, and it's described as having ""twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.""

Now when I read this the first thing that came to mind was Mrs. Weasley's clock which is described in the books as being extremely rare if not unique, at least according to Dumbledore. I always found that this made sense given how old a family the Weasleys are and how huge their family (immediate and extended) is. 

Are there any other instances of watches or clocks that would look or seem abnormal to Muggles? I want to say that students are mentioned having watches throughout the series, but I'm not 100%. Since there is no electrical devices that can function at Hogwarts, any watch or clock must operate with a face and hands. Does anyone else have a watch like Dumbledore's or is it an invention of his like the infamous table of silver instruments in his office? And does anyone have any idea how it works? It seems as though he can tell time based on the movements of the planets based on the watch's description, but I suppose it could simply be a normal watch with planets in place of the numbers. I doubt this however, since the planets are described as moving around the outside of the watch and J.K writes that it ""must have made sense to Dumbledore"" inferring that someone else looking at it would be confused.

The similarities of the Elder Wand and the One Ring,"I was wondering what exactly a duel with the Elder wand would be like. We know from Rowling that the Elder Wand is simply the most ruthless of wands in that it will only take into consideration strength, it knows no loyalty except to strength. It's completely unsentimental. It will only go where power is. This reminded me of the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings. The One Ring willed its way out of Isildur's possession. So similarly, as you start to lose a duel with the Elder wand (based on the raw skill/talent you and your opponent have) would the wand simply stop being all powerful because it knows that your opponent is stronger?

What is your opinion that may cause you to be unpopular in the fandom?,"Note: let's be free of judgment here. No downvoting an opinion you don't agree with. This is a thread to confess those opinions without being judged. 

Mine: People who say the movies are bad because they cut stuff and made changes need to really reconsider their definitions of a good movie. When adapting a book to film there has to be a point you stop trying to make a good adaptation and focus on making a good movie. Book and film are two separate mediums. Same for TV. What works in one will not always work in the other. By narrowing the films down to Harry's core story, the team managed to find the perfect balance between faithfulness to Rowling's books and making good movies. Including everything from the book would just make it messy and unfocused. Film and TV has to be smaller, more linear and be less meandering. By focusing on just Harry's story, the films were able to be focused, well paced and excellent while keeping true to the spirit of the books. And JK herself even said she didn't mind how many changes they made as long as the core story was the same and there was a good film at the end of it. And we got 8 fantastic films. Saying they're bad just because they cut stuff shows a severe misunderstanding of the book adaptation process. NO adaptation will include everything. Every adaptation makes changes. If you dislike the movies as movies, fine. But disliking them because they didn't adapt everything is really not giving them a chance as there was no way everything would ever be included. Even the fan dream of a TV series would cut things and make changes. ",0,"What is your opinion that may cause you to be unpopular in the fandom? Note: let's be free of judgment here.

Including everything from the book would just make it messy and unfocused. Film and TV has to be smaller, more linear and be less meandering. By focusing on just Harry's story, the films were able to be focused, well paced and excellent while keeping true to the spirit of the books. And JK herself even said she didn't mind how many changes they made as long as the core story was the same and there was a good film at the end of it. And we got 8 fantastic films. Saying they're bad just because they cut stuff shows a severe misunderstanding of the book adaptation process. NO adaptation will include everything. Every adaptation makes changes. If you dislike the movies as movies, fine. But disliking them because they didn't adapt everything is really not giving them a chance as there was no way everything would ever be included. Even the fan dream of a TV series would cut things and make changes. "

"Theories on Apparition, or, Just What are Death Eaters Doing?","One part of the HP Universe that has always intrigued me is the modes of travel, and particularly apparition. The concept of being able to transport from one place, nearly instantaneously, to another, is a lot of fun to consider. However, I've always wondered exactly what it is that Death Eaters do in order to transport to Voldemort when their Dark Mark burns, as it does not seem to fit with the constraints set down in Half-Blood Prince.

Wilkie Twycross states that the three D's necessary for apparition are Destination, Determination, and Deliberation, meaning that ""one must be completely *determined* to reach one's *destination*, and move without haste, but with *deliberation*"". Based on this description, the apparator must know their destination before apparating. Compare this to what Death Eaters do.

Voldemort is able to summon his inner circle (the only ones branded with the Dark Mark), by pressing his wand to the Mark on one follower, causing the others to burn, signalling they are to instantly join him. However, recognize that at no point in this is Voldemort's location given. It is assumed that the Dark Mark is a version of a Protean Charm, similar to the Dumbledore's Army coins. So I would postulate one of three scenarios for what the Death Eaters are doing:

1. In some way, Voldemort's location is communicated to his Death Eaters when the Dark Mark is activated.

2. Death Eaters have some other form of travel not previously explained in the universe that they use to join Voldemort. 

3. Apparition is much more complex than Twycross explains and it is actually possible to apparate to A PERSON, and not just to a destination.

I would be very interested to hear others opinions on my theories and if there are any others that I may have missed!",0,"Theories on Apparition, or, Just What are Death Eaters Doing?

Why didn't Voldemort plan his ressurection?,"So the principle of the horcrux is that it ties your remaining soul / your spirit to Earth if your body dies. Voldemort was extremely afraid of death and created horcruxes to escape death.
Since he researched horcruxes intensively, he must have known or guessed to what state he would fall if his body dies.

Now, why didn't he plan for that? He complains that none of his death-eaters went looking for him (which admittedly didn't seem too hard, considering Wormtail found him in a matter of months), but why didn't he tell them a place to meet? Or to prepare the ritual for him? Also, why didn't he seek them out himself? 

Seems like this could have spared him some very tedious ten years.

I mean, if I knew my soul was going to survive my body, I would extensively plan my ressurection, so that I am ready again by dinner.",0,"Why didn't Voldemort plan his ressurection?

And Little Barty, He came from a respectable Pureblood family, and showed cunning and ambition, throughout his fathers subjugation of him under the Imperius Curse. And then showing extreme cunning, and dare I say, brilliance in orchestrating the plan to capture Alastor Moody and Kill Harry Potter for his Master.

But first, preparations need to be made before the party can really get started. This assignment will be broken down in two parts. 

###Part one: 

Come up with an invitation for this party! You will be graded on creativity, design, and correct details. The sky‚Äôs the limit for this invitation: a powerpoint slide? A subreddit? A regular flier? Your choice! The only rule you must follow is that it must be done as a house. Please send your finished invitations to /u/Hogwarts_Sir_Nick. **DUE OCTOBER 25th at 9PM EDT.**

###Part two: 

Have you wanted to play quidditch for your team but haven‚Äôt gotten a chance? Well, Sir Nicholas needs your help collecting party items from his fellow Hogwarts ghosts! The Bloody Baron is leaving out rotten food, the Grey lady has some old instruments and the Fat Friar is bringing the black, morbid candles. But watch out for Peeves too! Never one to miss a joke, Peeves will be handing out Headless Hunt buttons to many students! These items are worth points; Peeves‚Äô being negative points, and the points stand as follows:

* + 10 points for any instruments, food or candles found (like a quaffle!)
* - 10 points for any headless hunt badges (much like a bludger you can pick the house you want the negative points to affect)

The house with the most points at the end of the month WINS! It‚Äôs just like quidditch - first to submit wins the points! **COMPETITION ENDS AT 9PM EDT OCTOBER 25th! Google form is [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNNVKZRojV8xrSNHl249hK20OIJSmjXG1jEgJ0wufQXHyXEQ/viewform)!**

The aliens of the Wizarding World,"I pretty sure the magic of the Harry Potter world is the result of a Prometheus type visit from aliens. They enabled/spliced a cluster of recessive genes into the human race that allowed them to use advanced ""magic"" technology. 

They understood the nature of intelligent beings in a competitive biological environment so they snuffed out their ability to advance the magic via snuffing information magic. This explains much about the Wizarding World. Most if not all spells are utility spells that can be cast on the spot for instant use. However, there are few spells and abilities that can tell the wizard about the world around them. This explains why Dumbledore can cast a charm that can almost instantaneous detect and deny access to a person based on their age but jewels at the bank still need to be analyzed by eye.

 Knowing that humans will try to advance anyway, aliens granted the illusion of advancing in a few select fields. This explains why a group of four post high school grad students were capable of constructing a covert pocket sized map that can track and identify any all  people in a certain perimeter but a highly sought after chamber of massive size stayed hidden for roughly 1000 years while being hidden right under their nose. The Wizards of Harry Potter have no actual knowledge of how magic interperets waves in the natural world.

Additionally, the Wizarding World is incapable of any kind of warfare. This is made obvious by the major emphasis on stealth, defending, healing, and meeting basic human requirements to survive. Meanwhile the wizard equivalent of a siege is shooting small arms at a fortified castle. 

TL; DR Aliens wanted to grant humans access to their technology but did not want humans to weaponizing it so they eliminated our ability to understand it and limited what humans can use it for. Consequently, the wizards of Harry Potter are in a permanent state of hiding and technological stagnation until the day muggles have knowledge of such advanced technology.

This idea was inspired by a submission from  our very own Head of Gryffindor /u/kiwias. Since this idea was submitted almost a full year ago, I will still award them ***TEN POINTS!*** The homework will be graded by the professors in conjunction with the moderators. This assignment is worth up to 30 points, and, as always, the best assignment from each house will earn an additional 10 points and a randomly chosen assignment will earn 5 points.

October and November's assignments will be directly related to each other, so make sure you come back next month to complete our adventure!

#Fantastic Beasts.....

Luna Lovegood married Rolf Scamander, grandson to the infamous Newt Scamander. This Halloween, Luna and Rolf are visiting Hogwarts for the feast and to visit some beloved teachers. Hagrid in particular is preparing feverishly for the big arrival. He wants to show Rolf all of his new monster creations and propose some entries into Rolf's upcoming new edition of his grandfather's 1927 masterpiece. 

Below are some points to consider when completing your entry:

* What animals did Hagrid use to breed a new species?
* What is its name? What does it look like? Any special markings?
* Which traits did it take from each parent species? Does it have any new traits/behaviors that weren't seen in the parent species?
* What type of magical properties does this new species possess? 
* Where do they live? Can wizards keep them as pets? Is there a new sanctuary for these animals to live peacefully?



However, you can deviate from these suggested pieces of information as much as you like! The judges require only that your description be comprehensive enough to follow your ideas.

October Extra Credit - Potions,"***This assignment has ended! You can view the results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5a8sk6/october_extra_credit_potions_results/)!***

Welcome to Potions! October is a fantastic month for brewing. Your extra credit assignment will focus on demonstrating your skill and/or enthusiasm for potion-making. This assignment has three components; you may do any or all of them. There are 333 House Points for you to earn.


#THEORY
**This portion of the assignment is worth a total of 60 House Points.**

Brewing potions is fun and rewarding, but the best potion makers understand *why* their potions work in the first place. Please write a set of instructions for brewing a potion - this could be a standard potion or one of your own creation. If you are also submitting a Brewing project you may write your Theory essay about the same potion (but make sure to submit the essay separately for credit). The essay should be no less than 150 words and should include, at minimum:

* Any ingredients needed
* The different steps of making the potion.
* An explanation of how at least one of the ingredients helps to achieve the desired effect of the potion.

These requirements are the minimum, but you can be as detailed as you want! Each Theory assignment can earn up to 10 Theory points. 60 House Points will be divided among all Theory points earned. 


#CAULDRONS
**This portion of the assignment is worth a total of 95 House Points.**

In Potions class we often fail to appreciate the tools that allow us to create our favorite elixirs. This month I want you to focus on your cauldrons! Create a work of art featuring a cauldron. This could be a drawing, painting, sculpture, or any other kind of artwork. Your options are limitless; the only requirement is that it must feature a cauldron of some kind (with or without potion). A caption could be helpful but is not required. Each Cauldron can earn up to 10 Cauldron points. 95 House Points will be divided among all Cauldron points earned.

#BREWING
**This portion of the assignment is worth a total of 125 House Points.**

And now for the best part of Potions class - actually brewing the potions! For this part of the assignment students will brew a potion of their choice. This can be any liquid-based concoction you like. Please submit a summary or recipe detailing your process. At minimum you must include one picture of your finished potion. However, you may include more pictures - one for each step in the process, if you like! Each project can earn up to 20 Brewing points. 125 House Points will be divided among all Brewing Points earned.

Some examples of potions you could brew:

* Mulled Cider
* Mushroom Soup
* Homemade Shampoo
* Homemade Cleaner
* Felix Felicis (create your own recipe!)


These are just examples. You can brew any potion for this project! Please keep in mind that not all potions are fit for consumption.



#AWARDS
**53 House Points will be split among these Awards.**

* Half-Blood Prince Award (Best Theory Submission)
* Percy Award (Most Impressive Cauldron (report optional!))
* Apothecary Award (Best Brew!)
* The Great Pumpkin (Award for the Most Halloween-ish Submission)
* Dumbledore Award (Last minute points to my favorite entry)

HP Reread: Prisoner of Azkaban,"So what are we doing here? Each week, a member of the mod team will post a discussion thread about a novel in the series, and that post will remain stickied for a week--two, in the case of the two longest novels in the series, OotP and DH. That means our reread will last a total of 9 weeks, finishing on the very day FBAWTFT is released. *^It‚Äôs ^almost ^like ^we ^planned ^it ^that ^way‚Ä¶*

In our discussion threads, we invite everyone to share their thoughts about the book (or movie, if you prefer) up that week. We‚Äôll provide some questions to consider, but they are in no way meant to be a restrictive list: **all discussion related to the series is welcome!** 

####Some possible questions to consider, if you like: 

* At the top of Year 3, we meet 3 new Professors. How do their characters shape the course of the series? 
* Boggarts as a not-so-obscure instruction to face the things which scare us most: Discuss.
* Snape is super unwilling to hear anything positive about any of the Marauders. As an adult in charge of educating every pupil on Hogwarts campus, how does this trait align with his career choices? How does that conflict begin to play out in Year 3?
* Discuss: ‚ÄúYou think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don‚Äôt recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble?‚Äù
* What is this book's ultimate take on Divination? Does any one character represent this belief? How does that align with later books?
* Was Harry right to leave Pettigrew alive? Would you do the same?
* Mirgy points out that Wormtail is left handed based on evidence beginning in this book. What other details do you notice?
* Does imprisonment in Azkaban constitute ""cruel and unusual"" punishment? What does it indicate about the wizarding world? 
* Moostronus wonders, ""Why is Remus Lupin so godly omfg &lt;3""
* This is the only year in which Voldemort does not seem to influence events. How does that affect the way the book fits into the series?
* How has your perception of this book changed over time? Do you remember what it was like reading it for the first time?
* Were there any surprises as you read? Plot elements you forgot, jokes you missed, etc?
* How well does the movie stand up to the book? 
* What is your favorite chapter (or chapter art) in this book? 
* What else?

If you have ideas for future discussion questions that you don‚Äôt want to forget, PM me and I‚Äôll add them (or a slightly revised version of them) to the list for the appropriate week.

Please note: unless you are referencing specific details from CC, spoiler tags in our reread threads are **not necessary**!

"Random memory, JKR once spoiled one of the biggest mysteries heading into Deathly Hallows (Who is RAB)","After HBP came out, the internet was abuzz over the latest Harry Potter plot developments. One of the most frequently discussed topics was just who the hell was RAB. It didn't take too long before some fans hit the nail on the head, Regulus Black. It was a fun theory and it fit.

Then JKR went and did the dumbest thing you could imagine and essentially confirmed the theory was correct...before the final book even came out. All her biggest fans are actively wondering who RAB is, and she just had to go and release new info that Regulus' middle name is Arcturis, like that would ever go unnoticed by the masses.

Sure enough, the RAB mystery turned into less of a shocker than Mrs Figg being a squib.

Why do Tom Riddle and Voldemort have separate character profiles on Pottermore?,"Like...WHAT? I don't care what ""point of view"" you're looking at, Tom Riddle and Voldemort are the same person. He didn't cease being Tom Riddle and suddenly turn into another person.

It's a small, metal cot and a single table and chair. No personal belongings or warm blankets. And then you have Luke Skywalker who's raised on a farm with his aunt and uncle, well-fed, and stuff, yet he supposedly ""struggles"" with the ""Dark Side"" in the movies and yet he's perfectly pampered all of the time. Yeah, his aunt and uncle died, but guess what? Tom Riddle never even knew his mother or father, let alone his aunt or uncle. Tom's guardians were frequently mean to him at the orphanage and the other children bullied him. Dumbledore was rude to him and distrusted him instead of helping. Meanwhile, everyone is all appreciative of Luke even though he worked for nothing. Tom Riddle got a job after school and made innovate while Luke sits around a and dance.

CGI in Fantastic Beasts,"First of all, super stoked for this movie. Like beyond excited to see what this new series will bring, and as someone who lives in NYC, it's going to make living here even more fun.

However, I just have to vent somewhere. I'm not too thrilled about the intensity of CGI in this latest trailer. I think somewhere along the lines of half the Potter films (*cough david yates*) there was just a surplus in excessive CGI, from overusing Priori Incatatem (sp) to the random puffballs on Luna's shoulders. 

I get that the Potter-verse is filled with magic and creatures etc. But looking at the practical effects in Star Wars Force Awakens and even the first Potter films, PoA (dementors specifically) it's just kind of a bummer that they aren't integrating more of those practical effects. I love seeing the magic come to life and spells in duels making a crazy scene, but if I wasn't a Potter fan I would have seen that trailer in a theater and rolled my eyes and thought it was a Chronicles of Narnia esque film (in visual style).

Anywho- I'll wait to see it before I hate on it, but still not over the fact that randomly in OotP every villain can suddenly turn into a black mist and dissolve like alka-seltzer",0,"CGI in Fantastic Beasts First of all, super stoked for this movie.

More evidence that Petunia cared for Harry more than she let on..,"Rereading HBP for the zillionth time and got to the part when Dumbledore comes to visit privet drive (one of my favorite scenes) and he mentions that Harry would be coming of age soon.

 ""'No' said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore's arrival""
 
Then she backtracks talking about Dudley's fat-ass birthday, but I took the ""No"" as in a ""no, not yet. He's still protected"". Like she knew what that meant, that he'd be in grave danger. 

Although she never treated Harry like her own, I wonder how much of it was for Vernon's sake and residual spite for her sister who had a world of magic opened up to her that she couldn't be apart of. Jealousy that her parents applauded all of Lily's specialness that resulted in her feeling left out. Not to mention Lily marrying one of them further leaving her out.

BUT she still cared about him, he WAS the only child to her only sister who met an untimely demise. I'm not sure where I read this, but weren't they very close before lily discovered she was magic?

I'm sure this set up worked great for the storyline, but wouldn't it seem way more worthwhile for the schools and the students if each task was done at each of the different schools, with some type of social event?

#What the heck is HPRankdown?

HPRankdown was a project where 2 users from each house took turns eliminating characters based on their literary merit (or lack thereof). ""Literary merit"" can be defined in any way the rankers see fit. We want the Rankers to have as few restrictions as possible when evaluating the characters, and want to allow for multiple different interpretations and angles.

#What sort of time commitment is this?

If your application is accepted, you will be expected to submit three write-ups per month. These can take as little as ten minutes in the beginning (because really, there's only so much you can say about Aiden, Lynch, and Moran) or several hours in the case of /u/bisonburgers' [Dumbledore write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4gffw4/albus_dumbledore/) (the winner of Rankdown 1). In the final two months, I found the average to be about 1.5 hours per write-up, 3x per month. 

___

#Will I have any warning before a write-up is due?

In the beginning of each month, you will have a chance to indicate your availability. You will only be tagged to submit a write-up on days you indicated you are available. However, you will have a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 47 from the time you are tagged until the time you need to submit. This just depends on when the person before you submitted their own post.

___

#This sounds hard. Why in the world would I sign up for something like this?

* To generate some high-quality verbal discourse!

* To write about your opinions on shit!

* To cut people for shock value! (just kidding about this one, but be prepared to be accused of it by people upset you cut their favourite character!)

* To forge friendships with the other rankers!

* To put that giant brain of yours to work so it finally stops melting!

* To have a fantastic time discussing Harry Potter in a unique setting!
",0,"Harry Potter Rankdown 2 applications are heating up. Throw your name in the hat today! Good morning/afternoon/evening, Potter fans!

[For those unfamiliar with the Rankdown, please read our initial post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/54c5wj/harry_potter_rankdown_2_wants_you_to_join_the_team/)

Harry Potter Rankdown 2.0 applications have been open for about a week, we‚Äôve seen your sterling submissions...and we want more, more, and more! We want a cast of awesome people ready and eager to undergo the Herculean task of ranking 200 Harry Potter characters from worst to first. We want you, dear reader, even if you‚Äôre on the fence, even if you‚Äôre not sure about your capabilities, even if you didn‚Äôt follow /r/HPRankdown initially, to jot your name down and **write your heart out in [this application](https://goo.gl/forms/5vjFBYazKFtBe1SF3), which should take about half an hour to complete.**

We want you to put your best foot forward in these applications; **we‚Äôre looking for insight, personality, persuasive argumentation, and style.** We want to read *why* you think Harry Potter is well or poorly written, or *why* Pigwidgeon is a god amongst owls. If you feel like you have more to say, don‚Äôt worry about overloading our inboxes, and write as much as you need! If you‚Äôve submitted and think you can do even better than before, we‚Äôre more than happy to accept resubmissions.

To make life easier for our rankers, we‚Äôve decided to bring up our deadline.

#Our new deadline for applications is Thursday, October 6th at 11:59 PM EST!

If you have any questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask on this post, and we‚Äôll answer them to the best of our abilities! You can also tag in the comments or reach out to:   

* /u/bisonburgers or /u/tomd317 (Gryffindor)  
* /u/k9centipede, /u/AmEndevomTag, or /u/DabuSurvivor (Hufflepuff) 
* /u/Moostronus, /u/SFEagle44, or /u/hermiones_teaspoon (Ravenclaw) 
* /u/elbowsss or /u/OwlPostAgain (Slytherin)

#What the heck is HPRankdown?

HPRankdown was a project where 2 users from each house took turns eliminating characters based on their literary merit (or lack thereof). ""Literary merit"" can be defined in any way the rankers see fit. We want the Rankers to have as few restrictions as possible when evaluating the characters, and want to allow for multiple different interpretations and angles.

Gamp's Law and Food at Hogwarts,"So I've reread the whole series and started thinking about more specific aspects of magic, like Gamp's Law and food.

We already know that food on the great hall is not created of nowhere, but transported magically from the replicas in the kitchens to the tables up in the hall.
Also we know that the house elves are actually cooking all day long for this.

But what about the raw materials?
Do they bring them from Hogsmeade?

We know that according to Hermione you can Multiply food, and that Hagrid Raises chickens [maybe pigs?]. What about they have a single Pig and multiply it indefinetely?

[We don't know exactly how many students are there](http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/doing-the-math-how-many-kids-are-at-hogwarts.html) but anyway that's a lot of food to store for a whole year.

I know that maybe they have ""magical refrigerators that keep food forever in good state"" but just wondering about the funny idea of a single pig being replicated forever to feed the whole school.
Given that you can't create food out of thin air for example on this scene Dumbledore apparently creates a plate of tea from nowhere, but for sure he actually invokes it from the kitchens.
&gt;""More tea, I think,"" said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat &gt;down.",0,"Gamp's Law and Food at Hogwarts So I've reread the whole series and started thinking about more specific aspects of magic, like Gamp's Law and food.

"Fake Moody, Magic, and Unforgivable Curses","I am re-reading GoF and the chapter that talks about Mad Eye Moody teaching the students the unforgivable curses really got me thinking. So the curses are unforgiveable, meaning that after you use the curse it should in theory alert a ministry member that the curses were being used in the vicinity of a specific area. (Think back to Harry getting in trouble because of Dobby). Knowing that Dumbledore got special permission for the REAL Moody to use the curse, wouldn't it alert the ministry that another person other than Moody was in fact using the curses? I am not remissed to think since Hogwarts is a school of Magic, the oversight would only be with the heads of houses and Dumbledore. But, is it possible someone at the ministry could be alerted of Barty Crouch Jr using magic?",0,"Fake Moody, Magic, and Unforgivable Curses I am re-reading GoF and the chapter that talks about Mad Eye Moody teaching the students the unforgivable curses really got me thinking.

Regarding harry and the horntail,"I was re-reading GOF, and I noticed something regarding harry's triumph over the horntail in the first task.

These lines are what caught my interest-

He flew higher. The horntail's head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before its charmer....

""Come on,"" harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, ""come on, come and get me.....up you get now...""

Could harry have actually spoke parseltongue to the horntail ?

When the horntail is first seen it is described as being more reptilian than the other dragons

And when harry ""hissed"" for it to come get him and to get up, it immediately does.

I thought maybe this was a case of unnoticed parseltongue, spoken to a very reptile like dragon.

Do the Ilvermorny Houses really overlay Hogwarts Houses?,"I'll start by saying I'm a Slytherin, and a Slytherclaw according to an unofficial Hybrid House quiz. I'll follow that up by saying I'm a Pukwudgie.
Now, looking at the traits of the various Ilvermorny Houses, I felt as though I should have been sorted into Horned Serpent; As they favor scholars and represent the mind.

It comes from Pinterest and postulates that the Ilvermorny Houses overlay the Hogwarts Houses. So, according to this image, the Ilvermorny Houses are something akin Hybrid Houses.
The problem I have with this theory is that I am a Slytherin, or Slytherclaw... And yet, I am a Pukwudgie, which is essentially Huffleclaw (If you follow the logic of this image).

So my question is do you think this is a valid concept? And if it is valid, can someone explain to me how I'm a Pukwudgie instead of Horned Serpent?

[Theory with spoilers] Nagini is Voldemort's mother (sort of),"A little 'out there' but hear me out.

After Quirrell's body was destroyed in PS/SS Voldemort's spirit fled to the forbidden forest. Voldemort is forced to possess some small creature just to survive.

Now, we know that the forbidden forest is home to all sorts of creatures, and that at least one 'banned' pet from Hogwarts has escaped there and flourished (Aragog)... so what if through the years pupils have tried to sneak in other 'banned' pets that have either escaped themselves or been released into the forest. 

Now imagine that two of these were the Gaboon Viper (the largest breed of Viper) and the African Rock Python (a large Python that actually looks after its young (a rare trait in snakes)); and at some point they bred to create a hybrid snake that was very large, venomous and with a maternal instinct.

So, Voldemort as a small animal runs across Nagini (the aforementioned hybrid) who promptly eats him... Voldemort now is forced to possess one of the eggs forming inside Nagini‚Äôs body.

Move forward to the hatching of the eggs... several normal snakes and one 'Mini-mort', but being a mother Nagini cares for all of them.

Move forward again, on the edge of the forbidden forest an animagus has just escaped his captors by turning into a rat. This rat runs into the forbidden forest for safety and is promptly trapped by Nagini to take back to feed her young. 

Rat death-eater meets mini baby Dark Lord/Snake hybrid... and the rest, as they say, is history

How does England manage to develop prospects for professional quidditch?,"So quidditch is a huge sport in the wizarding world, with a sizable league in Britain as well as many other countries, and a yearly international tournament. What I've really got to wonder, for many reasons, is how exactly does England manage to scrounge up enough talent to sustain so many teams?

People often discuss the logistics of getting those players together, but the foundations of their player development system is just absurd.

As far as we're aware, the first opportunity kids get a chance to play quidditch for real is when they attend Hogwarts, and usually not until at least their 2nd year. By the time future pro athlete muggles are that age, they usually have a solid 6-8 years of experience in their respective sport. That's usually just mastering the basic principles before the real battle begins to be noticed by the right people.

Also at Hogwarts, they have no coaches. Or rather, the captain of each team serves the role of a coach. Which means at no point do prospective quidditch players ever have guidance from somebody with a significant amount more experience and knowledge of the inner workings of the sport. They're just left entirely to their own devices and have to learn the sport for themselves, which just leads to bad players. So when players graduate school and try to go pro, they pretty much have to forget everything they know and be taught from scratch. Teams would have no real idea whether a player could conceivably learn to play the game proper.

Finally, there doesn't appear to be a draft, or even player scouting for that matter. Even taking into account that Harry was always playing on top tier broomsticks compared to his schoolmates, he was supposed to be an exceptionally talented player with little to no practice. So where the hell were the pro quidditch teams during Harry's run in Hogwarts. Given that he's so famous and quite talented at the sport, at some point we should have seen teams start to invite him to practice with them over the Summers or something, start developing him as early as possible to see where he goes.",0,"How does England manage to develop prospects for professional quidditch?

Impressions after reading/watching the first 3 books/movies,"I made a post here a few weeks ago about jumping into the HP world for the first time. All I can say is... **WOW!!!** I can't believe what I've been missing! I love Harry Potter.

These are now my favorite books and quite possibly the best books I've ever read. I know they're written for a younger reading level but I absolutely love Rowling's style; there's humor, suspense and a profound sense of wonder I've not seen in other works (though I admit I've only recently become an avid reader so I haven't read many books yet). These books just feel like home. I just ordered the paperback box set on Amazon, can't wait!

As for the movies, I've seen 1-3 so far and loved them all. Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were both super faithful to the books and very satisfying; Prisoner of Azkaban started veering of a little but still hit most of the highlights. I understand it's not really possible to pack so much detail into a 2.5 hour movie but I've just been thinking how amazing it would be to have a much longer movie that really fleshes out all the little details.

Anyways, here's what I love/don't love about each movie:

**Sorcerer's Stone**

What's that I hear? JOHN WILLIAMS?!?! This was such an amazing and unexpected surprise! I had no idea he scored the HP movies but as a lifelong Star Wars fan I knew right away who was behind this gorgeous music.

This one was the most faithful to the book and although there were some minor characters/bits of story not included, I don't recall anything major that was missing. I have been blazing through the books and movies though, so I'll have to go back and do a re-read/watch in the future.

Casting was phenomenal, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Alan Rickman as Snape were amazing, but HOLY SHIT. Richard Harris as Dumbledore was just *perfection*. For me he really is Dumbledore come to life, he was exactly as I imagined him in the book. Harry, Ron and Hermione were all great for their age, and I loled at seeing Walder Frey just strolling around Hogwarts (I'm a huge GoT fan as well).

Lastly, visual effects. I loved the set design (especially inside Hogwarts) but oh god the CGI, especially during the Quidditch/flight scenes.

**Chamber of Secrets**

More John Williams! This one seemed just as faithful as the first, with only minor changes/omissions. Again, fantastic casting. Tom Felton and Jason Isaacs are perfect as the Malfoys. I loved all the Weasleys, Fred and George's (and Arthur's) antics crack me up. CGI seemed slightly improved but flight scenes were still hilarious. There was one part though, that had me **dying** of laughter: when Ron and Harry crash into the Whomping Willow and Ron makes this totally unexpected high-pitch squeal as he says ""What's happening?"" Oh lord I could watch it over and over again, here it is https://youtu.be/gJgsaWD3prs?t=72

**Prisoner of Azkaban**

3 for 3 on John Williams!

Ok. This movie is missing a few things, but the most glaring is this: where's the Quidditch Final?!?! It was such a great match in the book and I was so looking forward to seeing it come to life, especially after seeing how much the visual effects had improved in the first (and only) match. And where's Oliver Wood? I love his character in the books and liked his actor in the first 2 movies. Aside from Quidditch problems, everything else was pretty great (Expecto Patronum!), though the story seemed to be moving very fast. 3 for 3 on casting as well, all the young actors just keep getting better. My only gripe is Dumbledore. Obviously someone had to step in, but after seeing Richard Harris (RIP) play the role, no one else feels right for it.

All in all, I loved each of the movies and will definitely buy the Blu-Ray collection, but the books are just plain better. I just started Goblet of Fire and I'm so excited for the rest!

Constellations Assignment Results!,"##CONSTELLATIONS!

We had a fairly good turnout for this assignment and I just wanna say thanks to everyone that participated! Now, without further ado, I give you the assignment results!


**[DRACO - laiquerne of Ravenclaw](http://imgur.com/wNTVvn0)**

* The constellation Draco refers to the greatest dragon of all time, Draconificuris Pogumnis de Vonderland-Rabitus, known to his friends as Draco. Most known for saving pure-hearted maidens from arranged marriages with horrible old princes, Draco was mourned all over the world when he died (of old age) at the respectable age of 4590 years. Legend says that all the fair maidens cried so long and so sorrowfully that Draco was lifted up into the sky and became immortal, an eternal protector of maidens everywhere. - Accioice25454 of Hufflepuff


**[THE HOUSES - Metaformed of Slytherin](http://i.imgur.com/FlOcA5F.png)**

* During the formation of Hogwarts by Salazar Slytherin, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Godric Gryffindor, the four selected animals that were associated with both their own personal traits and the traits they wished their houses to embody. They did so one night while drinking some mead outside, over the candlelight. After an odd burst of wind snuffed out the candles, Godric gazed up at the stars. He had selected the lion, symbol of bravery, and realized while looking up that some of the stars formed the shape of the lion. Upon commenting to the others, the remaining three quickly found groups of stars that formed the animals they had also chosen. So, not only did the houses of Hogwarts represent traits, but also aligned with star formations that from thence on were known as the Lion, the Badger, the Eagle, and the Snake. - marsthemush of Gryffindor

* Augustus Baffle (911-1224) was the first to discover this peculiar formation of stars in the year 1156 when he was still the first Proffessor for Astronomy at Hogwarts. Having had stayed up late with a cuple of his best students, being a tad too drunk, he joked about thinking that one formation ""truly resembled a snake and oddly right next to an eagle"". He noted it down, but when they woke early in the morning and Augustus read over it again, he believed it to not be just a coincidence, and thus he began studying these specific constellation, naming each after one of the four animals representing the houses of Hogwarts. Up to this date first year students are required to be able to know and tell about the exact location of the constellation in honor of the schools founders and houses. - chibibanane of Slytherin


**[NAVIGATION ARROW - asdf-user of Slytherin](http://i.imgur.com/PMMHqS5.jpg)**

* The Navigation Arrow constellation, also known as The Wanderer, has perplexed wizard astronomers throughout the ages. Its ironic name has led to the tragic deaths of many lost wizards - particularly children - because this simple cluster of four stars mysteriously changes its location in the evening sky, often multiple times in one night. Peculiarly, Bathilda Bagshot's Hogwarts, A History, references that even though the enchanted ceiling is meant to be an exact mimic of the sky, the duplicate of the Navigation Arrow star cluster exhibits a fixed position that rotates regularly with the other stars throughout the changing seasons. Bagshot asserts that this one detail may have led to the unfortunate loss of many lost children, who had not yet learned the story behind the wandering Wanderer. Scholars debate the cause of the constellation's travelling, but leading sources argue a similarity to the mysterious Room of Requirement at Hogwarts castle may lead to the Arrow's shifting positions - that is to say, the constellation cruelly misguides those who have greatest need of it. - Sevilyra of Ravenclaw

* The navigation arrow points towards a magical kingdom, undiscovered so far, though not for lack of trying. It first appeared in 2004 which is why we know it is actually made by aliens, not naturally appearing. Since then, we have been given multiple clues about the nature of the kingdom the arrow is pointing to. The kingdom is said to be full of chocolate and friendly animals but the coordinates don't seem to be pointing anywhere. The magical astronomy association is therefore offering an astronomical (heh) reward to anyone with information about the kingdom. - Accioice25454 of Hufflepuff

* The navigation arrow is an enchanted constellation, only visible to witches and wizards. While muggles use the North Star simply to travel north, the magical community can cast a spell once they find the constellation and it will point them in the right direction, if they are lost. ""Navigatus"" followed by your desired destination will cause the constellation to adjust to the proper direction. - feminist_cat of Hufflepuff
 
* The Navigation Arrow was a playful reply by asian astronomers dating back a couple of thousand years, saying it would point towards the best escape route from ones nagging wife at home, right into the arms of a beautiful and gracious dancer. Even though this meaning had just recently been discovered in 1980, when a couple of curse breakers had examined old parchments in Tibet. Before that date it had been a numerous noted and told constellation without anyone knowing any explation of it's existence. Given the actual story behind it, it still remains a joke between astronomers around the world, though it isn't teached about in classes any longer. - chibibanane of Slytherin


**[THE CROW - jarris123 of Slytherin](http://i.imgur.com/8dwmcsr.jpg)**

* First recorded during the Hellenistic Period of ancient Greece, this constellation was originally named ""The Mage"", but takes the title of ""The Crow"" every day of the year save one. According to historical records, the witch that discovered it also penned a fantastical account of her lover running afoul of a local - and very reclusive - goblin community, when he mistook them for savages and tried to trick them into bartering away precious goblin-wrought trinkets in exchange for some feathers. The goblins took the feathers, and gave the lover a circlet encrusted with emeralds and carnelian. 
The lover bid them farewell and, quite satisfied with his ruse, began making his way home with his expensive prize. Of course, goblins are not so foolish, and even then held no great love for humans. Not too far from the goblin camp, the lover suddenly found that the circlet weighed far more than it had moments before. It dropped to the ground with a tinkling clatter, and he with it. He picked himself up and scoffed at his own silliness, set on picking up his cargo and continuing on his way...when it happened again. He'd only managed to lift the thing scant inches off the ground before it became too heavy and fell back to the dirt. He tried again and again, straining with all his might, refusing to give up his precious circlet - but it was no use. The lover let out a frustrated and furious cry at the trickery, realising that perhaps the strange savages had not been as naive as he'd thought...but the sound that echoed around the trees was not that of a human. He stumbled away and pressed his back to the nearest tree, searching wildly for the source of such a terrible sound, head flitting in all directions, feathers fluttering anxiously. Then the poor sod came to an abrupt and rather horrifying realisation that he was, in fact, sporting a rather fetching plumage, and the source of the sound. He was a crow. The lover stared at the circlet in horror before taking to the skies and returning home as fast as the wind would carry him. Unfortunately, the witch knew much of stargazing, but little of cursebreaking. The lover took up a new role as the witch's familiar, and lived a much longer life than that of a human. According to her writings, however, it is stated that the lover was granted one day a year in his human body around the winter solstice, and so for 12 hours a year The Crow takes up the mantle of The Mage in most parts of Europe. As for the circlet...none like it have ever been documented. Any goblin asked of such a headpiece have refused to answer any questions, but such a response is unsurprising. Goblins are secretive beings, and no one really knows the entirety of what is hidden under Gringotts other than the goblins themselves. - rewindrevival of Slytherin

* The crow is located northeast on the summer night sky and was found and named by italien muggle-born witch Delfina Cavallo in 1995. Being therefore very recent and new, she was often asked for her reason of naming it, but any answer remained short and odd, as she always simplay said: ""I am a huge fan of the graphic novel and movie ""The crow"", given the constellation's form of a bird with wide outstreched wings, I simplay couldn't name it any differently."" Muggles. - chibibanane of Slytherin


**[TALPA - eclectique of Gryffindor](http://i.imgur.com/uhT0KTS.png)**

* The talpa is a little known magical creature resembling an animal known as a mole in the muggle world. Talpas are exceptionally intelligent creatures and commit most of their mischief by twilight. They play tricks on other animals; a talpa will take another animal's food and hide it on them. A squirrel might gather nuts, but unless it hides them well enough, it will fall victim to the talpa. A talpa's magical abilities are its super night vision, allowing it to engage in its trickery when other animals are most vulnerable. - feminist_cat of Hufflepuff

**[THE DIADEM AND THE SWORD - cncaswell of Hufflepuff](http://imgur.com/TrHY6MT)**

* Defined by seafarer Richard Rowing in 1501 BC the Diadem and the Sword is a constellation which is supposed to bring an early death by drowning for those born under it. This is according to Mathalda Trelawney, an early ancestor of the seer Cassandra Trelawney. Most wizards do not believe in this, and are the opinion it's a legend which came to be, because this constellation looks like an anchor. Other astrologists believe it brings bravery and thirst for knowledge for those born under it, but this even less common, probably due to the fact that it is less exciting. - asdf-user of Slytehrin

* The Diadem and the Sword present a terribly sad love story between a princess and a soldier but since they both committed suicide (they could not be together and all of that...) I'm afraid we shall never know the full story. I just know the princess' parents were known to have said: ""We wish she would have told us, of course we would rather have her marry a soldier than die"". - Accioice25454 of Hufflepuff


**[THESTRALLARIUS - marsthemush of Gryffindor](http://imgur.com/a/WR4rN)**

* Legend tells about a little girl, ages ago, who had no friends nor any family that loved her. She did things that no one could explain, and was soon labeled a freak and a weirdo. Little did their muggle friends and family know that she was a witch. Sadly, little did she know too.
Her only company was an imaginary friend she met in one of her solitary forest strolls. It couldn‚Äôt speak, but she could feel her presence and it was always there for her when she felt lonely or sad, accompanying her everywhere except for urban areas.
One day, some older men and women decided their village was no place for a girl like her, so they ambushed her in the forest. Magical as she was, there was no hope for against a dozen or so adult muggles. At least not if her friend hadn‚Äôt intervened.
It managed to save her life, killing all the ambushers, but it was badly hurt and dying too. The little girl was devastated, hearing her friend‚Äôs labored breathes, but unable to do anything about it. Her only friend, her protector, was dying, and all she could do was to wish and pray fervently that it wouldn‚Äôt left her.
Minutes passed by and eventually the breathing stopped. For the briefest seconds, the girl could see her friend, who took the form of a large skeletal black horse, before he turned into bright lights and ascended to the sky, where he forever watched over the little girl he loved.
The Thestrallarius constellation was discovered many centuries ago and supposedly caused quite a stir among astronomy circles.  Arthur Bluemoon was an amateur astronomer, the first to observe the constellation, but when he excitedly tried to claim his discovery within the Astronomy Society, he was promptly dismissed by most astronomers.
It was only weeks later, when his claims were revised by a different board, that wizards found out that, just like a thestral, the constellation could only be seem by those who have seem death.
After that, Arthur was accepted into the Society, eventually making some few other important discoveries. - laiquerne of Ravenclaw

* Thestrallarius is the protector of thestralls everywhere, guiding them and keeping them safe from predators by making sure no one accidentally bumps into them. In addition to that, thestralls can get very lonely and self-conscious because not many creatures can see them and Thestrallarius provides comfort to any thestrall that needs it. - Accioice25454 of Hufflepuff

* This constellation was first discovered by Ephorus of Cyme, a Greek who chronicled the wizarding world's involvement in Trojan War and, through the use of what is believed to be a philosopher's stone, lived until approximately 330 BC. Ephorus was present at the sack of Troy, the date of which he gives as 1135 BC. He saw hundreds of Trojans killed and, horror struck, traveled with Aeneas and other Trojan refugees into what is now modern day Italy. Along the way, they encountered a herd of Thestrals. Ephorus wrote of them, ""Those who had seen death could see them, those who did not, saw nothing."" In rememberance of those who had died in Troy, Ephorus and the other refugees found a cluster of stars that represented the mystical creatures, which they named Thestallarius. - marsthemush of Gryffindor

* The thestrallarius is named for the magical creature known as the thestral. The thestral is a guardian, and symbol, of death in the magical world. Its mysterious existence and inexplicable sense of direction makes thestrallarius a constellation that guides souls in a southern direction. Just as muggles always look for the North Star, wizards and witches often look for Thestrallarius. - feminist_cat of Hufflepuff

* The Thestrallarius constellation was known to wizarding folk since ancient times, and was in fact often mentioned in ancient astronomy texts. High mortality rates due to various then incurable diseases and the occasional plague meant that most wizards were able to see Thestrals from an early age and were in fact used to them. However, as medicine advanced, more and more people managed to survive the common diseases of the time, resulting in less deaths and Thestrals becoming a more uncommon sight. Parents started using them in scary stories told to little children to make them behave and when those kids grew up the Thestrals themselves passed into folklore territory, despite most magic beasts books verifying their existence. To follow this popular trend, the constellation itself started being referred to as the Flying Horse or Pegasus, in an attempt to disassociate it with any death relating connotations. Recent developments, however, especially after the Thestrals' involvement in the battle of Hogwarts have put the animals under a more favourable light, with many animal rights movements campaigning for the acceptance of death as a part of life in order to remove the stigma from the animals themselves. To show its support the Ministry of Magic has announced that this constellation will be officially called Thestrallarius once again, to honour the animals and commemorate the Battle of Hogwarts. - DarcRose22 of Slytherin

* in the sixth century a couple of runes had been discovered in an acient ruin in old Persia talking about Thestrals and their souls being birthed in a bright star on the coldest and longest nights in winter, clinging to life as death drags them down to earth. 
Afterwards more than a hundret stargazers and known astronomers from around the world began the search of said star and finally in 1541 Oidu Ejau, a student of Uagadou School of Magic, found the Star at the north winter night sky, he also named the horse-like constellation after the Thestral and pointed the brightest star at their wings, giving it the appearance to just be about to fly off.

**[THE BEATER - Sevilyra of Ravenclaw](http://i.imgur.com/JZkUeJL.png)** 

* The Beater is one of the most notorious sport-related constellations, first viewed and named after the explosive popularity of Quidditch in the 11th century. According to the historical writings of Gertie Keddle, a witch famous for recording the development of the sport due to its proximity to her home and her avid diary-keeping, the location of The Beater appeared perfectly positioned in the sky above the ancient Quidditch pitch at Queerditch Marsh, the location of the first ever Quidditch match, for the first time on its eleventh anniversary celebration and match. The constellation appeared to resemble a wizard mounted on a broomstick, holding a beater's bat, complete with a circular cluster of stars resembling a bludger, which in the earliest days of the game, were merely rocks that easily broke apart. Ever since its first noted appearance, the stars align perfectly every eleven and a half years to form the constellation of The Beater. - Sevilyra of Ravenclaw

* The beater is a lot younger than most constellations, because it's heavily tied to the Quidditch game, which is not as ancient as most constellations are. It's most visible during late summer, the time when the Quidditch World Cup usually takes place. The origins are unknown, but it's widely believed, that it originated as a PR stunt from the Irish Quidditch team during the 1809 World Cup - asdf-user of Slytherin

* The Beater is named after the first beater to have ever done the job, Percival Beaterius (I know, kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy). Until then quidditch was played in a way where bludgers were just flying around on their own, hitting whoever they wanted and the other players had to avoid them on their own. Sometimes bludgers got bored and attacked the audience.....those were not fun times. Anyway, the first beater was immortalized by the gods themselves and the beater constellation appeared in the sky. - Accioice25454 of Hufflepuff

* This constellation is named in honor of Magnus ""Dent-Head"" Macdonald, a Scottish Creaothceann enthusiast. Creaothceann is a game played on brooms where players must catch dropping rocks and boulders into a cauldron. Considered to be the most dangerous game on brooms, it was outlawed. Mr. Macdonald championed its return and was ultimately unsuccessful. The Quidditch position of the Beater is thought to have originated from Creaothceann. - feminist_cat of Hufflepuff

* The Beater constellation was only created in 2014 as part of the Quidditch World Cup celebrations. As the year marked 10 years from the 1994 cup, where the Dark Mark had appeared in the sky during the QWC, the organisers of the 2014 event wanted to create a Light Mark so to speak, to honour the games and the years of peace after the defeat of Lord Voldemort. The stars comprising the Beater constellation were magically enhanced to shine brighter throughout the tournament and spectators noted that it was a 'brilliant' way to celebrate the tournament. Subsequently, the merchandise created bearing the image of the constellation has increased in value and is sought after by numerous memorabilia collectors. - DarcRose22 of Slytherin


**[BASTIAN THE CASTER - boogtke of Gryffindor](http://imgur.com/a/RaZK3)**

* Bastian the Caster is known throughout the wizarding world as one of the first wizards of ancient times. We know little of Bastian today, or indeed any of the other founding wizards, but sources point to him being a shy man who preferred to keep his own company. He was also a noted healer of magical creatures. Bastian's most memorable story is his discovery development of Placement Charms, which he is said to have used to charm the first wild Kelpie into a docile state by placing a bridle over the horse-like water demon's head. This constellation is said to resemble The Caster lifting his wand as he placed the enchanted bridle. - Sevilyra of Ravenclaw

We had a fairly good turnout for this assignment and I just wanna say thanks to everyone that participated! Now, without further ado, I give you the assignment results!


**[DRACO - laiquerne of Ravenclaw](http://imgur.com/wNTVvn0)**

* The constellation Draco refers to the greatest dragon of all time, Draconificuris Pogumnis de Vonderland-Rabitus, known to his friends as Draco. Most known for saving pure-hearted maidens from arranged marriages with horrible old princes, Draco was mourned all over the world when he died (of old age) at the respectable age of 4590 years. Legend says that all the fair maidens cried so long and so sorrowfully that Draco was lifted up into the sky and became immortal, an eternal protector of maidens everywhere. - Accioice25454 of Hufflepuff


**[THE HOUSES - Metaformed of Slytherin](http://i.imgur.com/FlOcA5F.png)**

* During the formation of Hogwarts by Salazar Slytherin, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Godric Gryffindor, the four selected animals that were associated with both their own personal traits and the traits they wished their houses to embody. They did so one night while drinking some mead outside, over the candlelight. After an odd burst of wind snuffed out the candles, Godric gazed up at the stars. He had selected the lion, symbol of bravery, and realized while looking up that some of the stars formed the shape of the lion. Upon commenting to the others, the remaining three quickly found groups of stars that formed the animals they had also chosen. So, not only did the houses of Hogwarts represent traits, but also aligned with star formations that from thence on were known as the Lion, the Badger, the Eagle, and the Snake. - marsthemush of Gryffindor

* Augustus Baffle (911-1224) was the first to discover this peculiar formation of stars in the year 1156 when he was still the first Proffessor for Astronomy at Hogwarts. Having had stayed up late with a cuple of his best students, being a tad too drunk, he joked about thinking that one formation ""truly resembled a snake and oddly right next to an eagle"". He noted it down, but when they woke early in the morning and Augustus read over it again, he believed it to not be just a coincidence, and thus he began studying these specific constellation, naming each after one of the four animals representing the houses of Hogwarts. Up to this date first year students are required to be able to know and tell about the exact location of the constellation in honor of the schools founders and houses. - chibibanane of Slytherin


**[NAVIGATION ARROW - asdf-user of Slytherin](http://i.imgur.com/PMMHqS5.jpg)**

* The Navigation Arrow constellation, also known as The Wanderer, has perplexed wizard astronomers throughout the ages. Its ironic name has led to the tragic deaths of many lost wizards - particularly children - because this simple cluster of four stars mysteriously changes its location in the evening sky, often multiple times in one night. Peculiarly, Bathilda Bagshot's Hogwarts, A History, references that even though the enchanted ceiling is meant to be an exact mimic of the sky, the duplicate of the Navigation Arrow star cluster exhibits a fixed position that rotates regularly with the other stars throughout the changing seasons. Bagshot asserts that this one detail may have led to the unfortunate loss of many lost children, who had not yet learned the story behind the wandering Wanderer. Scholars debate the cause of the constellation's travelling, but leading sources argue a similarity to the mysterious Room of Requirement at Hogwarts castle may lead to the Arrow's shifting positions - that is to say, the constellation cruelly misguides those who have greatest need of it. - Sevilyra of Ravenclaw

* The navigation arrow points towards a magical kingdom, undiscovered so far, though not for lack of trying. It first appeared in 2004 which is why we know it is actually made by aliens, not naturally appearing. Since then, we have been given multiple clues about the nature of the kingdom the arrow is pointing to. The kingdom is said to be full of chocolate and friendly animals but the coordinates don't seem to be pointing anywhere. The magical astronomy association is therefore offering an astronomical (heh) reward to anyone with information about the kingdom. - Accioice25454 of Hufflepuff

* The navigation arrow is an enchanted constellation, only visible to witches and wizards. While muggles use the North Star simply to travel north, the magical community can cast a spell once they find the constellation and it will point them in the right direction, if they are lost. ""Navigatus"" followed by your desired destination will cause the constellation to adjust to the proper direction. - feminist_cat of Hufflepuff
 
* The Navigation Arrow was a playful reply by asian astronomers dating back a couple of thousand years, saying it would point towards the best escape route from ones nagging wife at home, right into the arms of a beautiful and gracious dancer. Even though this meaning had just recently been discovered in 1980, when a couple of curse breakers had examined old parchments in Tibet. Before that date it had been a numerous noted and told constellation without anyone knowing any explation of it's existence. Given the actual story behind it, it still remains a joke between astronomers around the world, though it isn't teached about in classes any longer. - chibibanane of Slytherin


**[THE CROW - jarris123 of Slytherin](http://i.imgur.com/8dwmcsr.jpg)**

* First recorded during the Hellenistic Period of ancient Greece, this constellation was originally named ""The Mage"", but takes the title of ""The Crow"" every day of the year save one. According to historical records, the witch that discovered it also penned a fantastical account of her lover running afoul of a local - and very reclusive - goblin community, when he mistook them for savages and tried to trick them into bartering away precious goblin-wrought trinkets in exchange for some feathers. The goblins took the feathers, and gave the lover a circlet encrusted with emeralds and carnelian. 
The lover bid them farewell and, quite satisfied with his ruse, began making his way home with his expensive prize. Of course, goblins are not so foolish, and even then held no great love for humans. Not too far from the goblin camp, the lover suddenly found that the circlet weighed far more than it had moments before. It dropped to the ground with a tinkling clatter, and he with it. He picked himself up and scoffed at his own silliness, set on picking up his cargo and continuing on his way...when it happened again. He'd only managed to lift the thing scant inches off the ground before it became too heavy and fell back to the dirt. He tried again and again, straining with all his might, refusing to give up his precious circlet - but it was no use. The lover let out a frustrated and furious cry at the trickery, realising that perhaps the strange savages had not been as naive as he'd thought...but the sound that echoed around the trees was not that of a human. He stumbled away and pressed his back to the nearest tree, searching wildly for the source of such a terrible sound, head flitting in all directions, feathers fluttering anxiously. Then the poor sod came to an abrupt and rather horrifying realisation that he was, in fact, sporting a rather fetching plumage, and the source of the sound. He was a crow. The lover stared at the circlet in horror before taking to the skies and returning home as fast as the wind would carry him. Unfortunately, the witch knew much of stargazing, but little of cursebreaking. The lover took up a new role as the witch's familiar, and lived a much longer life than that of a human. According to her writings, however, it is stated that the lover was granted one day a year in his human body around the winter solstice, and so for 12 hours a year The Crow takes up the mantle of The Mage in most parts of Europe. As for the circlet...none like it have ever been documented. Any goblin asked of such a headpiece have refused to answer any questions, but such a response is unsurprising.

Bastian's most memorable story is his discovery development of Placement Charms, which he is said to have used to charm the first wild Kelpie into a docile state by placing a bridle over the horse-like water demon's head. This constellation is said to resemble The Caster lifting his wand as he placed the enchanted bridle. - Sevilyra of Ravenclaw

Why weren't Sirius and Remus closer in OTP?,"I can accept that there's a lot we didn't see, but I always felt like there was too much distance (and a bit of coldness and aloofness) between Sirius and Remus in *The Order of The Phoenix.* Why would this be?

I've also wondered why Lupin didn't move in with Sirius as it would solve some of the problems of Lupin's poverty and Sirius' loneliness, frustration, and a desire to connect with his youthful antics.

I can see Sirius being concerned about Lupin being a straight shooter and discouraging his wily nature, but seriously, I would have thought that these two would have reconnected more deeply, and it bums me out.",0,"Why weren't Sirius and Remus closer in OTP?

A Very Angry Rant from a Very Angry Hufflepuff,"IRL Context: Extremely bored during class, so I whipped up a huge fictional rant from a Hufflepuff. Showed it to my friend, who said i should post it here. This speech does reflect my views and thoughts on the Houses in anyway and was done purely for mild entertainment. And yes, there is a lot of insults flung here.

In-Universe Context: Muggle Born Hufflepuff is extremely frustrated at his Houses, and a weak reaction from his House from a insult made by a very rude Gryffindor completely sets him off. This speech does not reflect his views in *most* ways, and was done ~~only~~ mostly to reinvigorate his House. 

Okay, what the hell us this? These pansies are just... ARGH. *angirly jumps on to the table as the entire dining halls turns towards him* Oi oi! Is this what I got dealt when I was sent to this miserable excuse for a House? A bunch of spineless little snowflakes who melt and mope like garbage when a toothless Lion just slightly growls at them? I mean, at this point, you might as well tear down every fucking effigy of our ""mascot"" and proceed to collectively urinate on them, because none, and I mean none of you deserve to represent the Badger. The Badger that, when I got Sorted into this house, I was proud to represent. You all remember when that Slytherin bitch called me a Mudblood? I didn't know how grave the insult was. I didn't think much of it. Still, I gave her a good fucking knuckle to her jaw, because that's what a badger does. Whether it's a cobra, a hive of bees, a huge Eagle, or a massive Lion, a Badger fights. A Badger goes in tooth and claw. We have the most proud and most competent of all the mascots. The Eagle is a coward who flies above danger and only hunts prey much smaller and weaker than itself. The Ravenclaw would call that wisdom, trying to hide the fact that they're just scared to take risks. The Snake crawls along the ground, and tries to avoid fights, shrinking back and only using it's fangs as a last resort. Those rascist fucks at Slytherin say that it ""exemplifies cunning and patience,"" when all it really is is a bunch of pompous douchebags who only know how to retaliate, who would rather shy away ""in a polite and courtly manner"" because they'd rather not get their new robes dirty. The Male Lion that the Gryffindor so proudly wave about like a monkey discovering fire is just a lazy fuck who lets the others in the Pride work for him, while he eats and sleeps and fucks all day. Those crimson meatheads would claim that's leadership, when it's just manipulation using fear and a false display of strenghts. But the Badger, she fights. She sees a Lion twice her size, who could probably easily crush her underneath his jaws looking at her funny, and she walks up to him and slashes the fuck out of his ugly mug. Hissing and spitting, she makes him pay with blood for a small insult. Before they see her claws come out, they assume she's mellow and gentle because of her quiet nature, but she is a powder keg ready to explode at the slightest touch. That was my vision when I first stepped into our Common House. However, what I see at the table made for Badgers are a bunch of fucking skunks, who shrink and stink up the place with their submission when a leaf slightly whispers angirly at them. Especially you, Mr. Seeker, oh great Prefect of the House of Helga Hufflepuff, the one who has caught exactly zero of the Snitches I've seen in all my two years at this castle. You know what? Why dont you sit back and spectate like the meek little daisy you are, while a real Badger shows you how to play? Oh, I don't know how to play? What, you think I haven't been paying attention to the rules of the sport? Do you take me for someone with the same level of intellect and awareness as yourself, Reginald? And I know you know how skilled I am with a broom. I swear, by the end of tomorrow, you - (addressing the entire hall) ALL OF YOU- will know what it means to be a Badger, to lash out indiscriminately and unmercifully, and feel rage so hot that sheer persistence alone will bring your enemies to their knees, shriveling and whimpering like the fucking flowers they are.",0,"A Very Angry Rant from a Very Angry Hufflepuff IRL Context: Extremely bored during class, so I whipped up a huge fictional rant from a Hufflepuff.

House changing and how closely you feel to your houses wands and patronus,"Hi guys! So I grew up with Harry Potter and after my initial ""I LOVE GRYFFINDOR"" phase, I looked and said I would probably be a Hufflepuff, I'm not outstanding and I place friendship and love above all else. Took the test here and BOOM! I'm smoking the huffiest of puffs. 



Even though I adore HP I never really bothered with Pottermore until recently, I wanted to know my Patronus (St Bernard woop) when I glanced at the House sorting part, I scoffed and muttered yeah Huffle fo lyf. 



Surprisingly I got placed in Ravenclaw APPALLED at how wrongly I had been placed I looked through the welcoming message, ""Place education above all else"", a year or so after being a Hufflepuffer I began my training to become a teaching assistant. 


I don't know if its just a coincidence but I find it odd my house changed after my circumstances in such a profound way. Wondering if any of you have experienced anything similar to that, or if its uncommon to have a change of house. Also has anyone had a Wand, House or Patronus charm assigned to them that they feel closely related to in such a way.

Extended Harry Potter universe,"So just like most of the people here, my sister and I read the harry potter books when growing up. Those are our fondest memories. I don't know if anybody else feels the same, but somehow we could never wrap our minds around all these new books, play and movies that are being released. It just feels like the universe is being stretched a lot unnecessarily. Don't get me wrong, it's a great thing for new people who want to get into the HP franchise, but we feel our memories connected to the original 7 books are just too precious. Maybe having a tv show with 7 seasons, and showing all the content, would have been a better choice. Well anyway, thanks for reading if anyone actually did till the end. *crack sound as I apparate*",0,"Extended Harry Potter universe So just like most of the people here, my sister and I read the harry potter books when growing up.

How may JK (and fanfic writers) portray Native American wizards the *right* way?,"So as we all know by now, Jo really bungled her Pottermore portrayl of Native American wizards, both in terms of culture and history (Native American and European wizards have always been in contact, and yet smallpox was still a thing? And racism didn't exist between the two groups at all? Really, Jo?) 

Unfortunately, I have to admit that in a collaboration fanfic with some friends, we too world-built about Native American wizards, and while we were more faithful and respectful in terms of what the history would be like, we fell into the same trope that JK did, saying that their wizards were medicine men and healers, and I *almost* was going to go even further down that stereotype, until I learned just now that those tropes were just that, stereotypes, and harmful ones at that. This was especially distressing to me, because I have some Native heritage that was lost to me, and I saw writing this fanfic as a way to research and get back in touch with it. Therefor, I'm especially interested in rectifying this problem, and better understanding *how* Indigenous peoples should be portrayed in Potterverse fiction. 

While a small number of people were outraged that JK even wrote anything about Natives when she's not one, most people that I've seen on twitter and other articles, were never opposed to her writing about the wizarding world in Native America, they just disliked how she did it. Most of them say that the issue could have been rectified if JK had simply *asked* a Native American what the Native American wizarding world would look like. 

That's exactly what I'm going to do here. Thankfully, my friends and I haven't talked about Native Americans in *too* much detail in the fanfic we're writing, that part of the story has fallen upon me, and what little we have discussed has been said by non-Indian characters in the story, so we have plenty of wiggle-room to set the record straight in the fanfic. 

So, I'll ask all the Native American Potterheads out there: what tribe/tribes are you a part of, and how would your particular tribe respond to the existence of wizarding folk? What role would they have in your tribe's society, and how would they respond to the Statute of Secrecy, once Europeans began settling and taking over the continent? 

Specifically, for my own fanfic, the Native American characters which feature are half Navajo, half Hopi, so if you're of one or both of those tribes, then I'd especially like to know about those in particular. I've done some research on wikipedia and html museum sites, but I'd consider a primary source more reliable :)

Fan Theory: Grindelwald started WWII,"With Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's duel taking place in 1945, and JK Rowling stating that the date was no coincidence, many fans have theorized on Grindelwald's role in World War II. Most theories claim he was a Nazi. My theory doesn't just claim he's a Nazi. This theory claims he is THE Nazi. The whole theory starts with some historical background of the setting. Let's start with the Versailles Treaty. This treaty ended the First World War, but was extremely biased toward the Allied powers. The German people are infuriated and are nearly third-worlded by the economic and administrative hardships resulting from the treaty. Enter Adolf Hitler as a rising political figure in the late 1920s. Beer Hall Putsch, burning of the Reichstag, mass rallies, the whole lot. Soon Hitler's Nazi party holds the majority in the Reichstag and he is elected Chancellor of Germany.

Let's take a break from the history lesson for a moment to review Grindelwald's motives as a Dark Wizard. Grindelwald felt that Muggles were beneath wizards and should be treated as such. Therefore he had to find a way into power to spread and enact his ideals. Given the state of the world post WWI (not only the Muggle World, but the Wizarding one as well), Grindelwald didn't have to look far. The German wizarding government (called the Weimar Republic of Wizards at this point in time) was made up of wizards firstly, but they were Germans secondly, and they too felt the sting of the Versailles Treaty. The WRW lost much of its population as a result of the land cessations the Muggles made. Who else was to find a solution but Gellert Grindelwald, claiming that he could restore the wizards to their former glory and more. Grindelwald was a master manipulator, and we can only assume he was a brilliant speaker, just like Hitler. He quickly ascended the ranks of the WRW until he became its leader.

In the sixth Harry Potter book it is revealed that the Prime Minister of Britain received visits from the Minister of Magic. Therefore, when Hitler dissolved the office of the President of Germany to become undisputed F√ºhrer, he also received visits from Grindelwald, now leader of the wizarding government. Having become obsessed with the occult and seeing how similar their goals were, Hitler jumped at the opportunity to use the wizards to his advantage. However, little did he know that he was being played by Grindelwald. If wizards suddenly appear out of nowhere and subjugate the Muggles, they'd fight back, and probably win. However, if they take control of the one undisputed leader, they'd never know anything was afoot until it was too late to do anything about it. Grindelwald used the Imperius Curse on Hitler, effectively turning him into his puppet. He then turned the Weimar Republic of Wizards into the National Socialist Wizards' Party, abolishing any democracy and placing him as the wizards'  own undisputed leader. His Hitler puppet then established the Nuremberg Laws and ran fear-mongering campaigns to the German people, forcing them to trust the government and giving the Nazi party the authority to arrest any political dissidents, especially those in the Wizarding World. Of course, separation between the worlds was still necessary. Even though the dissolution of the International Statute of Secrecy was his goal, the world was not yet ready to know of Wizards, and Muggle security defenses probably would not be able to handle Wizard prisoners. Therefore Grindelwald built the Nurmengard prison to house dissenting wizards and concentration camps to hold dissenting Muggles. This practice continued until the end of the war.

Next came the mobilization for war. For his master plan to take the next step, he would need to ensure that all powers, Muggle and Wizard, were under his control. He had Hitler create an massive army ready to mobilize, completely throwing the Versailles Treaty to the wind. His first target was Poland, which fell in the matter of a month. Both the Muggle and Wizard governments of Poland fell under Nazi control. Hitler's war machine then blitzed through France, with the wizards unable to do anything to stop it due to the Statute of Secrecy. The Nazis then pushed the British out of Dunkirk, eliminating their presence in mainland Europe.

The London Blitz began in 1940. Grindelwald, and therefore Hitler, had a special interest in Britain, as it was the homeland of his rival Albus Dumbledore. Hoping to eliminate Dumbledore and the last piece of resistance in Western Europe, Grindelwald ordered the complete destruction of London. However, Churchill had heard of wizarding involvement from his own Minister of Magic, and the superior RAF, with some secret wizard help, successfully defended against the massive bombing campaign, and with Dumbledore alive, Grindelwald's hope of defeating all resistance had vanished, at least for now.

Grindelwald then proceeded to make an extreme blunder. He declared war on the USSR. While he certainly knew of the power that Muggles had, he did not account for the relative power between the armies of the Reich and the armies of the Soviets. While the Germans had done well early in the invasion, during the winter, the Soviets started to push back effectively, with weather conditions causing heavy attrition to the German forces and caused equipment to freeze up. Of course, neither wizard side could actively participate in the war due to the Statute of Secrecy, so Grindelwald had no way to reverse this other than attempt to rebuild the German war machine.

Then came another wrench thrown into Grindelwald's plans. December 7, 1941: Japan declared war on the United States with the attack on Pearl Harbor. This had both positive and negative effects. The Magical Congress of the United States would have their attention turned to the Japanese Empire while Grindelwald could focus on the war unchecked. However, the Japanese asked Germany to declare war and aid them against the U.S. Grindelwald/Hitler had no choice but to declare war against the U.S. or risk losing a critical ally in their war against the Russians.

Fast forward 3 years: Spring of 1944: Churchill, FDR, and the leadership of both the MACUSA and the MoM meet to discuss the creation of an elite team of Aurors to infiltrate Germany and end wizarding involvement in the war. The Minister of Magic nominates Albus Dumbledore, already an extremely accomplished wizard, for the leadership of this team. June 6, 1944: D-Day occurs. Allied troops from Britain, America, France, and Canada storm the beaches of Normandy, pushing Grindelwald's forces back and giving the Allies a foothold in mainland Europe. Shortly after, Dumbledore's team is dropped off in mainland Europe with brooms to infiltrate the enemy lines. They are given a few elite Muggle squadmates (given so as to make any engagements with the enemy look as if it were an act of Muggle combat and forced to sign non-disclosure agreements under penalty of treason) and brooms. Told to fly low so as to not alert enemy radar of their intrusion, Dumbledore's team successfully infiltrates enemy lines and begins their search for Grindelwald. They search a number of abandoned houses, believing he would hide himself in seclusion, but this is not the case. Instead he is hiding within the leadership of Germany itself, disguised as one of Hitler's aides.

It would not be until the Allied armies surrounded Berlin where Dumbledore would find Grindelwald hiding with Hitler in the F√ºhrerbunker. A few days before the F√ºhrerbunker is breached, Grindelwald had Hitler kill himself, as he was no longer any use and was the only link to him causing the war and the oppression of Muggles. When Dumbledore's team arrived at the bunker, a number of Aurors and soldiers were killed by gunfire from defending forces. Upon neutralizing them, Grindelwald revealed himself from his disguise and attacked the remaining forces. Only Dumbledore survived. Through a magical duel I doubt I have the creative capacity to describe, Dumbledore eventually defeats Grindelwald and locks him up in his own prison, bringing to an end the European theater of WWII.

So how exactly did Grindelwald plan to dissolve the Statute of Secrecy? It's simple. First he needed to dominate the entire world, which probably was the hardest of all tasks in his master plan and the task which he never accomplished. Once all nations were under his control, Grindelwald would use Polyjuice Potion and have Hitler introduce a number of Wizards as evolved Aryan members of the ""German Master Race"" and ""Friends of Germany"" with laws giving special rights to Wizards and eventually wizards of every race were to be given supreme rights over the oppressed Muggles of the world. This is how Democracy dies. With roaring applause.

This is in no way canon (yet) but is just my explanation of how Grindelwald was involved in World War II.

Patronus != Spirit Animal,"I've seen a lot of people approach the Patronus test as a personality test, consequently being disappointed by their result because it didn't fit their image of themselves. So I wanted to make a little PSA for clarity. 

&gt; ""The Patronus, asserted Spangle, represents that which is **hidden, unknown but necessary** within the personality.""


&gt; ""Here, says Spangle, is the explanation for the appearance of **Patronuses in forms that their casters might not expect, for which they have never felt a particular affinity**, or (in rare cases) even recognise. Spangle is interesting on the subject of those **unusual witches and wizards who produce a Patronus that takes the form of their favourite animal**.""


&gt; ""‚ÄòIt is my firm belief that **such a Patronus is an indicator of obsession or eccentricity**. Here is a wizard who may not be able to hide their essential self in common life, who may, indeed, parade tendencies that others might prefer to conceal. Whatever the form of their Patronus, you would be well-advised to show respect, and occasionally caution, towards a witch or wizard who produces the Patronus of their choice.‚Äô""


[Source](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/patronus-charm)

From the article we can see that, at least it's implied; witches/wizards producing Patronuses identical to their favourite animal is the exception, not the rule. Rather, a Patronus will manifest in a form symbolic of one's subconscious happiness, love, aspirations, etc. 

These can align, of course, as I'm sure they have for a lot of people. It may be less common, but still frequent, for a person's favoured animal to also represent what drives their happiness. This would be especially likely amongst the large number of introverts that this fandom attracts (ie. being more prone to introspecting on these things; greater self-awareness). 

The test almost requires metaphorical thinking as you answer, to attain an ""accurate"" result. 

For those people whose Patronus and preferred animal aligned, this isn't to devalue your result, as that is also a valid outcome. 

Finally, a preface that this isn't to dismiss the other flaws in the test, such as being partially RNG-based, having arbitrary and subjective questions, and just generally being not actual magic. However, this is still one facet of the test that has seen a lot of misconception, and the one part this post covers, purely for clarity that one's Patronus != their surface-level personality.

Do you think there are wizards constantly researching and developing new spells or magical artifacts that would make their lives more convenient?

Asian wizards and witches at Mahoutokoro,"I'm a Korean, born and raised, and thinking about the fact that Korean and Chinese wizards and witches have to go to Mahoutokoro is a bit frustrating. Korea, Japan, and China have vastly different mythology and cultures and magic.

*Imagine the absolute mayhem this would cause. The politics alone would be a nightmare.

Hufflepuffs are immature bullies,"In his fourth year, Harry was bullied by many Hufflepuffs, ""Potter stinks"" they said. Hufflepuffs also appear to be very immature as we see when Cedric Diggory is lying on another Hufflepuffs lap while being downright stupid. This was in middle of the Triwizard Tournament, and while the other contestants including Harry were hard at work about solving the first task, Cedric and other Hufflepuffs are spending their time being immature. Just notice how Hufflepuffs in general act, they act like your typical school jerks.

They also made ""Potter stinks"" badges which they attached to their school uniformes, now if that isn't immature and downright evil I don't know what is. Hufflepuffs are basically ordinary teen agers who doesn't display much interest in magic. They are not heroic and brave like Gryffindors, and neither are they intelligent and original like Ravenclaws. Hufflepuff also produced the worst Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. A man who punished the victims of Voldemort's return, and who probably even aided the Death Eaters. (PS! the yellow Hufflepuff school uniform is ugly.)

Patronus Disappointment Survey results (kind of),"So, yesterday I started [a survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFluC1BfvauPGu7acpA45KmMuzgjQdU44-AN1Hytr38a_l4A/viewform) about the satisfaction with the results of the patronus tests.

* As I thought, people who got horses where the most unhappy, with 22% satisfied and 55% disappointed (the rest being uncertain)
* People with small mammals were the most satisfied with 83%. But felines, canids, and aquatic animals all got 0% disappointment rate (with varying amounts of uncertainty)

"Ron, Hermione and Neville are NOT true Gryffindors","Ron Weasley was definitely not a Gryffindor. He was not brave, nor was he heroic.

Peter and Thomas Sitting in a Tree...,"Do we know how Peter comes to be a servant to Voldemort?

Did Pettigrew seek Voldemort out because he wanted to be close to powerful wizard or because he wanted to be on the winning side? 

Or did Pettigrew falter when actually faced by the death eaters/ Voldemort and switch sides to avoid a more imminent death?

He seems so cowardly to me so the latter seems most likely, but considering he was a Slytherin contender, it makes sense that he would want to position himself closer to Voldemort because of his power.

Chapter by Chapter - 7.17 Bathilda's Secret,"[Link to previous chapter](http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/53yqfn/chapter_by_chapter_716_godrics_hollow/)

**Synopsis**

They see someone watching them. They exit the graveyard and find Harry's old house. An old lady approaches them. It's bathilda. They follow her to her cottage. He finds a picture of the unknown wand thief. She asks to see Harry alone. Bathilda is revealed to be Nagini. They fight a little while she tries to restrain him. Harry and Hermione apparate away just in time. Harry finds out his wand was broken in the fight. 

**POI**

- so was Nagini just watching James and Lily's grave every night waiting for someone to show up?  Since Nagini is a snake and therefore ectothermic, wouldn't it be dangerous for Nagini to be out there in the snow?

- Harry says the fidelius charm on the house must've died when James and Lily were killed. Why would that happen?   The charm is meant to still be enacted after that. I guess that's how Hagrid was able to get Harry from the wreckage when he was a baby. 

- I'm surprised the Potters old house hasn't been restored. It's a pretty important historical landmark. 

- do you think Harry would ever come back and fix up the old place?

- Harry speculates that the house can't be rebuilt due to dark magic. But I don't think that's true. I just don't think anyone could be bothered. 

- the sign says that Harry is the only person to have survived the killing curse. Does Voldemort count now?  He kinda survived it. In a different way. 

- Harry says the house should be invisible to muggles. Why is that?  The fidelius charm doesn't work that way. And besides, the fidelius charm is supposedly broken now that James and Lily are dead. 

- Harry speaks to fake bathilda here. Shouldn't his parseltongue kick in?  He's speaking to a snake. And parseltongue is meant to be involuntary. Harry wouldn't be able to pick up the switch but Hermione would be able to. 

- do you think Nagini and Voldemort talk every night?  Maybe he calls he late at night and just says ""Hey baby. Just wanted to know what you were up to"". And Nagini is like ""I'm busy Voldy can we talk later"" and Voldemort is like ""you said that yesterday too. We never talk anymore!  Why don't you love me?""  And Nagini is like ""whoa babe. I do love you. I just don't need to talk every day"". I'm going to stop this inane conversation right now. It's ridiculous. 

- how similar looking is Nagini bathilda to the real bathilda?  Would they try to make her look similar given Harry doesn't even know what bathilda looks like anyway. 

- do you think anyone else got suckered in by fake bathilda before this?  Maybe other people came to Godric's hollow looking for Harry and got caught in her trap. 

- there are a lot of times when Harry and the trio are using polyjuice potion or invisibility cloaks where the movies basically ignore it. Obviously they had good reason to do so. I understand why they'd do that. 

- first sign that Bathilda is a trap. She's lighting fires without magic. Obviously Nagini as a snake can't use magic. 

- does Bathilda have any other family besides Grindelwald?

- three horcruxes are all together here. When Voldemort arrives, that's four bits of Voldemort's soul all in the same spot. It's the closest the horcruxes ever come to a reunion. 

- Nagini can communicate with Voldemort. This must be via the same connection that Harry has with Voldemort. And this is a major clue that Harry is a horcrux himself. A known living horcrux has the same ability as he has. 

- do you think Harry can see into nagini's mind via that same connection?  Can she see into his mind? We see Harry go into Nagini's mind before but that was when Voldemort was possessing her so I don't think that counts. 

- Harry is really slow on the uptake. He should've known as soon as he heard Voldemort saying ""Hold him""

- do you think Nagini should've just kept pretending to be bathilda until Voldemort came?  Could she have kept the charade going that long? 

- the image of Nagini coming out of the neck of Bathilda is one of the scariest images evoked in the Potter series. It's straight out of a horror movie. 

- could Nagini defeat Harry in a one on one fight? She has the element of surprise here. 

- why doesn't Harry apparate away as soon as he's being attacked?

- does Voldemort punish Nagini for letting Harry escape?

- Harry sees Voldemort's recount of the night he died. I thought for sure there would be something new revealed here. Jo repeatedly refused to answer whether there was someone else who came to godric's hollow with Voldemort that fateful night. And I thought that something big would be revealed here. Yet nothing came of it. It was a bit disappointing to be honest. 

- James died without a wand in his hand. He didn't even get a chance to defend himself. It's just so sad. It reminds me of Harry in the graveyard in GoF. He invokes the memory of his father when he comes out to fight Voldemort. And he talks about standing up and fighting even though you know it's useless. And that's exactly what James did. James had no wand. But he still wanted to fight. He still wanted to do whatever he could. 

- Voldemort says that Lily had nothing to fear. He really did intend to leave her alive. Imagine if that had happened. How different is the series if Voldemort leaves her alive? Pretty much nothing in the plot happens. Harry dies. Snape's still a death eater. And Voldemort continues his initial reign of terror. 

- he gave her a lot of chances. If he really was that keen to leave her alive, why not just stun her?  Why not do any number of curses which would incapacitate her?

- ""he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy...""  Another major clue that Harry was a horcrux. And I think Voldemort could've guessed it from what he knows. But he never delves into it. 

- Wouldn't it have been easier to imperius bathilda or put a death eater there?  Maybe polyjuiced?  That would've been more effective than using Nagini there. 

- Harry's wand breaking removes one of the last advantages Harry has over Voldemort. And I think it's a good thing from a plot perspective. It throws up the unknown. Can Harry beat Voldemort now that he's lost this big advantage?

He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralysed him as he saw the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been.

Dumbledore probably had a plan in the event that the wizengamot found Harry guilty. What do you think it was?,"Thought of this on my last read through the series.
Its seems pretty silly that he wouldn't have a plan, no matter how confident he was in the hearing, simply because how crucial the event was.

However, I cannot think of any obvious solution myself.

I doubt he would let them snap his wand, but maybe he would. I doubt Dumbledore placed nearly as much importance in defeating Voldemort on it as Harry did.

Most interesting I think however, is the question of whether or not this backup plan would cause dumbledore to drop the ""Ignoring Harry"" thing.


There's two possible outcomes I can imagine of this plan:


A: Let Harry be expelled, but make the best of it until the situation changes and he can return to school.

B: Do not let harry be banned, and intervene some other way.

I personally like to imagine Dumbledore going full battle mode in the court room. But somehow I don't think thats a real possibility.

Edit:
Also a reminder, Dumbledore thought that keeping harry in school was SO important that he was willing to let himself become an outlaw when the ministry found out about Dumbledores Army. Attacking Dawlish, Kingsley, AND the minister of magic to allow for harry's escape then.",0,"Dumbledore probably had a plan in the event that the wizengamot found Harry guilty.

Primary School,"I found myself wondering what the witches and wizards of the world did *before* Hogwarts. They don't attend until the age of 11, therefore had to have common knowledge beforehand.

Tell your story of the midnight release party you attended for the release of The Deathly Hallows.,"I'm writing a short story for my creative writing class, and through an exercise we did I got the idea of writing the story of Abigail, a young Australian girl with a drugged up mother who finds an escape through Harry Potter. The story takes place in a bookstore in downtown Melbourne on the night of the Harry Potter release. 

Unfortunately, I was only 8 when the book came out and don't have the clearest memories the midnight release party. I want to hear your stories to better write this one!

Pottermore Patronuses,"So now when we can check out our patronuses at pottermore, I encountered something a bit odd when I was taking the test for mine earlier today. 

It said my patronus was an ""unusual"" one so i had to take an extra question apperently. Now I just wondered if this was something that happened to all who took their test to make it feel like their patronus was with that more unique and more personal. Anyone else have this happen?

Turns out Trelawney wasn't a fraud at all,"Sibyl Trelawney takes a lot of crap from students and teachers throughout the series, (A LOT OF CRAP) but a closer read through will show you that every one of her predictions from small to large come true throughout the series. Are you a Nay-Sayer?? Let's take a look:

1. During the first lesson, she spits off a few rapid fire predictions to show off: Neville's GMA being ill, Pavarti warned of a red haired man, Neville breaking two cups, One of the students leaving in Easter, the thing Lavender feared would happen on the 16th of October, Neville would be late to the next class and classes would be interrupted by the flu. Of the things that Rowling goes into detail about, all come true while the other predictions are not elaborated on, they are not disproved. In regards to Pavarti; Trelawney was incredible nearsighted, and could have mistaken Pavarti for her twin, Padma, in which case the prediction does come true. 

2. Later that class period she decides to take a peek at Harry's tea leaves. She sees: A falcon- a deadly enemy. Duh. A skull- danger ahead, again Duh its Harry.. A club- an attack, which does happen by a bludger, dementor, and Sirius. Finally spotting the Grim, predicting Harry's death. Harry does ""die"" in the DH, but he would have died much sooner as a direct result of being around Sirius(The Grim)! The only thing that prevented the death, was intervention using time travel. 

3. Later in The PoA she gets all superstitious about sitting at a table of 13. saying ""the first to rise will be the first to die!"" Not knowing that 13 people were already at the table (Peter as scabbers). Dumbledore then rises to greet her, and poof he's the next to die. Same goes for later in the Siris who rises from a table of 13 in OoTP and dies later in the book. 

4. In the HBP she is traipsing about the castle looking at cards, reading them correctly but not understanding them. The two of spades, conflict, refers to her conflict with the centaur, and because he is in earshot, Harry's conflict with Voldemort. She draws the 7 and 10 of spades which refer to an ""Ill Omen"" and ""Violence"" both of which take the form in the Dark Mark and Lightning Struck Tower. The last  card she draws is the Knave of Spades which is "" A Dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner"" which happens to be Harry who is hiding behind a suit of armor. 

5. Of course her two formal ""real"" predictions both come true.

Trelawney is discredited in the books by everyone but the two most powerful and distinguished wizards: Dumbledore and Voldemort. She is treated as a fraud, but truly is a Seer. 

Another interesting tid-bit: She was descendent from Cassandra Trelawney who is a Seer in Greek mythology who was cursed by the god Apollo to make accurate prophecies, but never to be believed....",0,"Turns out Trelawney wasn't a fraud at all Sibyl Trelawney takes a lot of crap from students and teachers throughout the series, (A LOT OF CRAP) but a closer read through will show you that every one of her predictions from small to large come true throughout the series.

* Craft an engaging and in-depth write-up for the *weakest remaining character* in the available list.  
* Set-up your post, ensuring it's properly logged, and tagging the next ranker to go.  
* Stand by your cuts in the face of those who may disagree, and have a lot of fun doing it!

What body shape does Ginny have?,"Seems like a weird question but there is a method behind it. We know there seem to be 2 body types in the Weasley family. There is the Arthur body type which is tall and a bit thin, and there is the Molly body type, which is shorter and stocker (though in Molly's case overweight). For instance Ron is described as being taller than the twins by 4th year, and considering they are 2 years older than him and almost done growing that shows how much taller Ron is. 

eg

Goblet of Fire
&gt;""How're you doing, Harry?"" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. **Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky.** He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.

Death Eaters at WWHP Japan!,"I was super lucky to be in Japan for business and had a free weekend. I made it to USJ on Sunday and tried to capture as much as I could of the death eaters in hogsmeade! It was really entertaining and they did a fantastic job pulling this off. The crowds were huge and super excited!

The show starts at dusk with everyone standing in hog Meade on either sides of the main walkway. Then two green fireworks go off, one over the post office and one over ollivanders. Then the death eaters appear. Two at first, and they walk around intimidating the crowd. Then two wizards show up and the battle begins.  They move the length of the main road in hogsmeade, giving everyone a chance to see. They end up on the main stage for the final battle, where they are joined by more death eaters and more wizards. On stage there is now some talking in both Japanese and English. It was pretty fun!

The album I took in photos because the video was too dark. I took a lot of pictures to try to capture the flow. 

https://imgur.com/a/rtWWl

I also took a video, of the final battle.

https://youtu.be/lAn-chHQA48

The show replayed a few times while we were there, drawing a huge crowd each time.

I made it to USJ on Sunday and tried to capture as much as I could of the death eaters in hogsmeade! It was really entertaining and they did a fantastic job pulling this off. The crowds were huge and super excited!

The show starts at dusk with everyone standing in hog Meade on either sides of the main walkway. Then two green fireworks go off, one over the post office and one over ollivanders. Then the death eaters appear. Two at first, and they walk around intimidating the crowd. Then two wizards show up and the battle begins.  They move the length of the main road in hogsmeade, giving everyone a chance to see. They end up on the main stage for the final battle, where they are joined by more death eaters and more wizards. On stage there is now some talking in both Japanese and English. It was pretty fun!

The album I took in photos because the video was too dark. I took a lot of pictures to try to capture the flow.

I also took a video, of the final battle.

The show replayed a few times while we were there, drawing a huge crowd each time.

Video Game,"I think it'd be cool if there was a video game much like skyrim, but in the wizarding world. You create a character, get your wand, get sorted into a house. And have quests or challenges that you complete. Maybe pick whether your good or bad based on decision making and go from there.

How does Great Britain have such a large quidditch league?,"I realise this is a dumb logistical question, but I will ask anyway. The Hogwarts house teams in Harry Potter are quite small and there are only four of them. Hogwarts is portrayed as really the only large wizarding school in the U.K. So, one would assume it would be a primary source for new players; right? However in the series only two characters join a team in the British league (Ginny Weasley and Oliver Wood) and Wood, despite being a great keeper and captain is only a reserve player in the league. Which begs the question: where are they finding the players to support thirteen professional teams. Not to mention all the other teams around the world.

Something that is bothering me as I re-read about the Penseive/memories.,"Why not simply have Harry produce his memories into the pensive at the end of GoF or legit anytime after that. Obviously because of Slughorn we know memories can be messed with, but its always very apparent that is the case is it not? Plus if they had pulled his memory immediately after returning it could not have been altered away right?",0,"Something that is bothering me as I re-read about the Penseive/memories.

It was like you were in a separate reality, far away with your friends Harry, Ron, and Hermione. But once you read that last page, once all was well, you felt sad. Sad that you would never experience something so beautiful ever again. Sad that you would never be able to walk through the hallways of hogwarts again, or cast a spell at a bogart.

"Convince me to watch the movies...(or not, I suppose)","Ok, so I love Harry Potter.  I (like so many) read the books as they came out, found early websites devoted to discussing Rowling's wizarding world, listened to the books on cassette on an unending loop...you get the picture.  I dig HP and the fan community.  But here's the thing,


I've never been able to get into the films.  Not even a little bit.  I went to see the first two at the theater, and barely could stand the dissonance with my headcannon.  One night I rented POA with my sister thinking, ok, sure I'll give this a try, then got five minutes in and remembered DEAR GOD I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS AND BLOCKED IT OUT BECAUSE I WAS SO UNHAPPY.


This was all years ago, and I was quite young at the time. So now I wonder, is it time to give the films another chance?  Originally, I simply couldn't stand the way they cut out my favorite parts and above all when their depictions of my favorite characters fell short of expectations (ahem, Remus, Sirius, Dumbledore).


So I come forward now, fellow redditors, to ask your counsel.  Movie-lovers, sell me on them.  What do they bring to the HP universe that the books don't?  Why won't they ruin EVERYTHING I LOVE (exaggeration, but hey, younger me was a little dramatic)?

Theory: Dumbledore read Harry's mind during their meeting in Chamber of Secrets,"I've just had a thought while rereading Chamber of Secrets. After Justin Finch-Fletchley and Nearly Headless Nick are attacked, Harry is taken to Dumbledore's office. While he's in there, Dumbledore asks him if anything's wrong, and everything that Harry's planning and suspecting about the Chamber of Secrets flies through his mind: 

""'I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you'd like to tell me,' he said gently. 'Anything at all.'

He thought of Malfoy shouting, 'You'll be next, Mudbloods!' and of the Polyjuice Potion, simmering away in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: 'Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.' He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he as somehow connected to Salazar Slytherin...""

My theory is that Dumbledore may have been reading Harry's mind at this point. In which case, Dumbledore now knows that Harry suspects Malfoy, and is brewing Polyjuice Potion to find out if it's him. This may have even been the evidence that led Dumbledore to start suspecting that Lucius Malfoy planted something in Hogwarts that triggered the opening of the Chamber because of Draco's reaction (I'll admit that's a bit of a reach, but still). 

Dumbledore must of suspected that Harry might have discovered some things about the Chamber at this point, and was interested in finding out what he might know, I mean the safety of school is being jeopardized, he might be willing to invade Harry's privacy a little if it means saving the lives of his students and saving the school.

It doesn't specifically say in the text whether Harry was looking into Dumbledore's eyes while thinking all this (which Snape said was a requirement for performing legilimency). But it doesn't say Harry WASN'T looking at him either, or maybe Dumbledore doesn't even need a person to look directly at him for him to preform legilimency. 

In either case, I think its nice that Dumbledore didn't force Harry to tell him anything. If he did read Harry's mind he certainly didn't call Harry out for lying to him, but instead waited until Harry trusted him enough to confide in him at the end of the year.

Rewatched 'Prisoner Of Azkaban'; it's become my new favourite Potter film by some distance...,"I'd just like to start by saying that when I was younger up until around 2011 I'd probably watch the series through 2 to 3 times per year. Since then I'd only watched a couple of the films erratically and only recently decided to rewatch the whole saga chronologically.

I watched the first two films and got a massive nostalgia buzz out of it enjoying them immensely, but then I swear I wasn't prepared for the third. Since when was this film so good?

Everything just clicks perfectly, literally from the moment the titles come up it's clear the directing is on another level from the previous films and this holds throughout. The entire first 15 mins or so is brilliantly paced with the mundane Dursley life suddenly escalating to the absurdity of the Knight Bus journey, which is so much fun to watch.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on the Dementor train scenes, chilling in the most delightful way.

This time around the atmosphere is nailed on fantastic; just the right levels magic juxtaposed against dread. You've got the leafy greens and glowing yellows of Hogwarts slowly retreating against the gloomy grey of the Dementors and Sirius Black. It's neither the piercingly joyful spectrum of the first two films, nor the dreary, colour-sapped tone of the latter films; it's the perfect midpoint. Adding to this the soundtrack is overhauled, with the vibrant orchestra of the earlier entries replaced with a more melancholic and subtle, yet still magical score.

Not only that but the directing is so much more imaginative than the earlier, and even later instalments. There are just a plentitude of cool shots and transitions unparalleled in the series besides maybe HBP. Even the small things like the Whomping Willow season changes add structure to the plot and as the time passes we feel like we're edging closer to the inevitable fireworks when Black shows up. It all just looks gorgeous, and flows seamlessly.

The plot is also very engaging, this time around the threat feels constant. We are routinely reminded of the Dementors patrolling the grounds with a clear fondness towards Harry adding an immediate threat to compliment the looming menace of the ever nearing Black. All the scenes featuring actual schoolwork all meaningfully develop the plot as opposed to the necessary but meandering worldbuilding of the previous films, with the Boggart scenes being the clear standout.

And once we get to the day of Buckbeak's execution things go up a level. I haven't felt this nostalgia giddy over a film as I did in the last 45 minutes of this one in a long, *long* time. Everything comes to a supposed head, then the madness literally starts all over again. The time-turner completely pulls the rug out from under what you've expected from the film, and the scene in the Shrieking Shack has to be my favourite of the whole series.

And I even think the acting is at it‚Äôs best here than in any of the other films. Thewlis, Oldman, Spall and Rickman in a scene together is magnificent and they all play their parts remarkably well, Gambon adds a new energy to Dumbledore and the returning cast of older actors all give great performances, with Rickman in particular shining in one of Snape's larger film roles.

But it was with the younger actors where I strangely feel as though they're at an age where their ‚Äòacting style‚Äô is most suitable. They're mature enough that the dramatic, personal scenes are more believable yet young enough that the occasional gaff can be overlooked (**HE WAS THEIR FRIEND!!**).

The most common complaints I hear seem to be with regards to book deviations, and while I have read the book it was a long time ago and I barely remember any of the exact details. I hear that they put the firebolt scene at the end instead of midway through, removing a lot of mystery which I agree should have remained unchanged. And although admittedly the lack of a Marauders reveal irks me a little, I feel as though there are more than enough pointers within the film for the audience to go away and work it out themselves even if this is to the slight detriment of the series as a whole. But overall I really don‚Äôt understand how people find these critical errors.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not trying to fool myself into thinking this is a masterpiece or anything like that; only that it is a *great* fantasy film. All the Potter films are good fun, especially when infused with nostalgia, but I could honestly see myself thinking this is an excellent movie even out of the context of the series. The directing, music, plot and even acting for the most part all just comes together in a way that is a huge step up from the first entries, and that even none of the later movies can quite replicate. It just surprises me that it isn‚Äôt more accepted as the best of the series.

Gorgeous Collection of Harry Potter Fan Art by UpTheHill,"Hello everyone!

I'm the Editor of [FAN/FIC Magazine](https://fanslashfic.com/), a nonprofit publication for fanfic readers and writers.

I thought this sub might be interested in the latest [interview](https://fanslashfic.com/2016/09/26/fan-artist-upthehill-on-dramione-erotic-art-and-the-magic-of-portraits/) I conducted with a popular Harry Potter fan artist named UpTheHill ([upthehillart.tumblr.com](http://upthehillart.tumblr.com/)). In the interview, UpTheHill discusses a variety of things, including why she started doing fan art (hint: it's because of Harry Potter), what her creative process is like, and why she draws particular characters and pairings (Dramione, Drarry, the Marauders... Remus Lupin!).

I thought I would post the interview here in case anyone was interested in Harry Potter fan works and/or if you haven't heard of UpTheHill and her *gorgeous* artwork. She's one of my personal favourite artists in the fandom. I find that she captures angst and emotions *so well*. She also has a NSFW blog, which I won't link to here, but you can easily find the link to it on her [main art blog](http://upthehillart.tumblr.com/).

Anyway, post in the comments if you're a fan of UpTheHill and/or if you want to discuss your favourite pieces. (FYI, if anyone writes Harry Potter fanfiction or makes fan art/vids/other, let us know so we can follow you on social media!)

Anyway, post in the comments if you're a fan of UpTheHill and/or if you want to discuss your favourite pieces. (FYI, if anyone writes Harry Potter fanfiction or makes fan art/vids/other, let us know so we can follow you on social media!)

Dumbledore's Private Lessons with Harry,"In the Half Blood Prince when Dumbledore was teaching Harry about the Horcruxes and Tom Riddle/Voldemort, I think it would have been awesome if their lessons also included Dumbledore teaching Harry some advanced spells (as Hermione thought would be the case). It would have been really cool to read about and would have added more spells for combat and defences to Harry's arsenal. I understand that they had limited time and that Dumbledore was very busy searching for Horcruxes as it was but I just think it would have been very interesting.

Merchandise question for merchandise Monday (pen and ink enthusiasts),"So I have a question about some HP merch, and I thought it would be fitting to ask today. I am a Harry Potter fan, have been since my second grade teacher first started reading the class the first book. My family and I became hooked from there (I'm 25). Anyways I work professionally in the tech industry, but weirdly enough 2 of my great interests are mechanical watches, and pens/ink, go figure right haha. So to the point, on my recent visit to WWOFHP, I noticed they were selling quilt and ink. They seamed a bit of expensive and I was unsure of the quality of ink or nibs on the quil. I'm assuming those are just marketed to people who just the idea of using a quil fascinates them. My question mostly pertains to the quality of ink. So here it is, my 2 part question. Is the HP branded ink of good quality and color? And for those who are ink collectors as well, what inks would you recommend to build an HP themed set?

"Prefects, House points, and writing inconstistency?","I was rereading The Chamber of Secrets, and at one point Percy takes five points from Gryffindor for some reason.
&gt; 'Five points from Gryffindor!' Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge.

In Book 5, Draco took a number of points from Gryffindor as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad. Hermione told him something to the effect of **""prefects can't dock points""**.

My question is, which of these is correct? Could prefects dock points before OOTP (I'm assuming Hermione's correct in that book considering the circumstances), or is Percy just bluffing? It does appear to be an issue of inconsistency, although I'm not really sure about that.

Rowling may have hinted that Ilvermorny was designed by a Freemason.,"Stonemasons in England kept their knowledge of geometry and construction as a trade secret up to the 16th Century. They built cathedrals and churches, commissioned by the Catholic Church. 

The rise of Lutheranism broke the stranglehold of Catholicism over Europe, and fewer churches were commissioned (called The Reformation).

Stonemasons either went into other trades or traveled to find work. This meant that stonemason lodges were dwindling in number. 

These lodges finally allowed for Noblemen and philosophers to join, even though they weren't stonemasons, in order to pass along their knowledge and teachings. 

By 1616, the number of ""speculative"" masons outnumbered the ""operative"" masons. And this is where Freemasonry as we know it today, evolved.

Based on JKR's history of Ilvermorny, the original stone building was erected around 1630, designed by a displaced stonemason from England named James Steward. 

It's not clear if James was ever an ""operative"" mason, or if his knowledge of stonemasonry came from being a ""speculative"" mason -- but the time table suggests that Isolt's husband was a Freemason before making his trip to The New World. 

And perhaps Ilvermorny itself may hold Masonic nods throughout its construction. It would fit with the rest of the American east coast, all descended from the original colonies which Freemasonry had a large, social presence.

The Order of the Pheonix book vs movie,"At the end of the OOTP book, there is an emotional scene with Harry and Dumbledore that takes place.

My life is a lie (Sorting hat),"TL;DR Sorted into Gryffindor on old Pottermore, sorted into Slytherin 5 times in a row on the new Pottermore.

 Mini rant(?)

So I actually didn't know Pottermore got remade until news about the Patronus test came out. After doing the Patronus test (that came out to be a cat, which I am allerigc to lol) I tried to retrieve my old house, but I forgot my username so I just retook the quiz. I was sorted into Gryffindor on the old Pottermore, and this time it came out to be Slytherin. I didn't give much thought since I was going to retake the Patronus test on a new account anyway, but rinse and repeat 4 more times, and I ended getting sorted into Slytherin all 4 times. I'm feeling pretty crushed about this now, though many years ago, I had hoped to be sorted into Slytherin, but I eventually accepted being sorted into Gryffindor and I even own Hermione's wand, the Gryffindor robe and scarf, as well as a Gryffindor crewneck, all bought from WWoHP. On one hand my childhood dream has been fulfilled and I can't say I'm too too upset, but it's still disheartening. I don't know where I belong anymore :(

The Complete Pottermore Patronus Quiz Breakdown and Analysis: Everything You'll Need to Know,"Alright, since this post is going to be a long one, here is a quick rundown of what I'm covering:

* How the quiz works
* The list of all available questions and patronuses (with linked videos for each of them)
* The complete breakdown of the quiz, aka a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/199cZZOphQIOLddT-UrvrJxmKhTKbDw_h_kH98kBwKSY/edit?usp=sharing) that contains the answers for every single Patronus
* Whether a version with all questions is feasible

Feel free to just jump to whatever part of the post interests you most.

##How the Quiz Works
As most of you are aware, the quiz entails you to answer between 5 and 7 randomly selected questions with a time limit for each question.  If you fail to answer a question within the allotted time, you skip that question and go to another one.  Once you've answered enough questions, you get your Patronus.

Now, each of these questions come from a pre-determined question set.  For example, the first question set contains 5 questions, each having three possible answers.  Your first question will always come out of the first set, your second question will always come out of the second set, and so on.  At the minimum, you will answer exactly one question from each of the first five question sets.

So, how does the skipping mechanic work?  Well, if you fail to answer a question in time, that question will always be replaced by another question from that exact same set.  So long as you answer that replacement question, it doesn't matter that you missed the original question.  It'll be as though you were never asked that original question.  However, if you fail to answer two questions from the same set (missed the original and then missed the replacement), the quiz will reset itself and send you back to the first question set.

Next, let's talk about how the quiz determines your Patronus.  Simply put, the quiz takes a combination of your answers and matches it with a specific animal.  As for other factors, such as your house, wand, or even how long you take on the Patronus quiz, after extensive testing, none of them seem to have any effect.  Only your actual answers seem to change the results.

Well, if only the answers matter, doesn't that mean you could miss out on a specific Patronus because you didn't get a certain question?  Not at all!  You can get any Patronus with any possible selection of questions.  Why?  Because, for any two questions from the same set, their 2 or 3 answer choices directly correspond to another.  So, regardless of the actual question presented, as long as you pick the corresponding answer, you will always get the same results.

Speaking of results, most of you would presume that each unique combination would lead to a unique Patronus, and that's mostly correct.  For the most part, one specific combination of answers leads to a specfic Patronus.  However, there are three major exceptions.  The first exception is the Fox, Hedgehog, and Weasel.  For some reason, two distinct paths lead to each of these animals.  The second exception is the gendered animals (Stag/Doe, Leopard/Leopardess, Lion/Lioness, Tiger/Tigress, and all horses).  They all share the same answers as their counterparts, and, as far as I can tell, the one you ultimately receive is randomly determined.  As for the third exception, I discuss that one shortly below (for good reason).

In addition to leading to certain animals, some specific paths will lead to a sixth and possibly even seventh question, netting you either an unusual or very rare Patronus.  However, the sixth and seventh question sets operate exactly the same as the first five, with corresponding answers and answer combinations determining your Patronus.  Yet, certain unusual Patronuses have a strange characteristic: they share the exact same answer combination.  This (third) exception to the general rule means that you could plug in the exact same answers twice and get two completely different animals.  Even more surprising, the Shark and Leopard/Leopardess share an answer combination, meaning the exact same answers could net you three different animals.

Edit:  /u/stilapixie created a visual illustration of the various corresponding answers.  The link can be found in the comments below.  The list of corresponding answers can also be found beneath their respective question set and on the complete spreadsheet.

##The Complete Breakdown of the Quiz

This is probably the most interesting part of this entire post.  You will find the combinations that lead to every single Patronus on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/199cZZOphQIOLddT-UrvrJxmKhTKbDw_h_kH98kBwKSY/edit?usp=sharing).  Simply use the correct corresponding answer at each step, and you should be golden.  Unusual Patronuses are marked in green, and Very Rare Patronuses are marked in yellow.  For those categories, the first five steps are available on the first sheet with the additional questions on their respective sheets.

Just to serve as one more caution, for those seeking gendered animals and some of the uncommon ones, since they share combinations with another Patronus, I cannot guarantee you will get that one on your first try.  However, as I personally confirmed every single Patronus, I can guarantee the combination does work.  It might just take a few tries.  It's also indicated which ones share combinations with another animal so that you know it was no mistake on your part.

I hope you all enjoy my findings!

##Is a Quiz with Every Question Possible?
Finally, now that the quiz has been cracked, the question turns to whether we can create a full version with all questions.  I would say the answer is both yes and no.  Unfortunately, since the quiz relies on corresponding answers, we couldn't just throw all the questions in since people would undoubtedly give conflicting answers per question set.

However, after spending more time on this quiz than I ever thought possible, I'm currently drafting up a version that should utilize all of the questions, largely maintain how the quiz operates, and actually pinpoint your Patronus.  Stay tuned for more information.  Similarly, if there are individuals with experience with programming/coding quizzes who would like to help/has ideas, feel free to PM me.

##Acknowledgements
Finally, this post would not be complete without an Acknowledgements section since I would have never been able to do this on my own.  First, I would like to thank everyone who provided me with information.  Without that wealth of information, this would have taken a lifetime.  In addition, I would like to especially thank the following people:

* /u/Rocket_Sciencetist for helping collect the initial wave of data
* /u/ibid-11962 for initially compiling the list of questions as well as providing all of the Patronus video links
* /u/N1ffler for verifying the list of Patronuses using Pottermore's internal numbering system
* /u/LogicalRuse for figuring out how the quiz operated
* /u/Darth_Pyre for providing me the missing piece to crack the entire quiz
* The [Bassett Hound Patronus](https://patronus.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/fallback/videos/animals/BassettHound.mp4) for being the first Patronus I fully mapped out (despite not even being mine!) because, without that, none of this would have been possible...

Hope this information helps you all!

Sincerely,

Alolakazam  
A Slytherin cursed with the curiosity of a Ravenclaw",0,"The Complete Pottermore Patronus Quiz Breakdown and Analysis: Everything You'll Need to Know Alright, since this post is going to be a long one, here is a quick rundown of what I'm covering:

* How the quiz works
* The list of all available questions and patronuses (with linked videos for each of them)
* The complete breakdown of the quiz, aka a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/199cZZOphQIOLddT-UrvrJxmKhTKbDw_h_kH98kBwKSY/edit?usp=sharing) that contains the answers for every single Patronus
* Whether a version with all questions is feasible

Feel free to just jump to whatever part of the post interests you most.

##How the Quiz Works
As most of you are aware, the quiz entails you to answer between 5 and 7 randomly selected questions with a time limit for each question.  If you fail to answer a question within the allotted time, you skip that question and go to another one.  Once you've answered enough questions, you get your Patronus.

Now, each of these questions come from a pre-determined question set.  For example, the first question set contains 5 questions, each having three possible answers.  Your first question will always come out of the first set, your second question will always come out of the second set, and so on.  At the minimum, you will answer exactly one question from each of the first five question sets.

So, how does the skipping mechanic work?  Well, if you fail to answer a question in time, that question will always be replaced by another question from that exact same set.  So long as you answer that replacement question, it doesn't matter that you missed the original question.  It'll be as though you were never asked that original question.  However, if you fail to answer two questions from the same set (missed the original and then missed the replacement), the quiz will reset itself and send you back to the first question set.

Next, let's talk about how the quiz determines your Patronus.  Simply put, the quiz takes a combination of your answers and matches it with a specific animal.  As for other factors, such as your house, wand, or even how long you take on the Patronus quiz, after extensive testing, none of them seem to have any effect.  Only your actual answers seem to change the results.

Well, if only the answers matter, doesn't that mean you could miss out on a specific Patronus because you didn't get a certain question?  Not at all!  You can get any Patronus with any possible selection of questions.  Why?  Because, for any two questions from the same set, their 2 or 3 answer choices directly correspond to another.  So, regardless of the actual question presented, as long as you pick the corresponding answer, you will always get the same results.

Speaking of results, most of you would presume that each unique combination would lead to a unique Patronus, and that's mostly correct.  For the most part, one specific combination of answers leads to a specfic Patronus.  However, there are three major exceptions.  The first exception is the Fox, Hedgehog, and Weasel.  For some reason, two distinct paths lead to each of these animals.  The second exception is the gendered animals (Stag/Doe, Leopard/Leopardess, Lion/Lioness, Tiger/Tigress, and all horses).  They all share the same answers as their counterparts, and, as far as I can tell, the one you ultimately receive is randomly determined.  As for the third exception, I discuss that one shortly below (for good reason).

In addition to leading to certain animals, some specific paths will lead to a sixth and possibly even seventh question, netting you either an unusual or very rare Patronus.  However, the sixth and seventh question sets operate exactly the same as the first five, with corresponding answers and answer combinations determining your Patronus.  Yet, certain unusual Patronuses have a strange characteristic: they share the exact same answer combination.  This (third) exception to the general rule means that you could plug in the exact same answers twice and get two completely different animals.  Even more surprising, the Shark and Leopard/Leopardess share an answer combination, meaning the exact same answers could net you three different animals.

Edit:  /u/stilapixie created a visual illustration of the various corresponding answers.  The link can be found in the comments below.  The list of corresponding answers can also be found beneath their respective question set and on the complete spreadsheet.

##The Complete Breakdown of the Quiz

This is probably the most interesting part of this entire post.  You will find the combinations that lead to every single Patronus on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/199cZZOphQIOLddT-UrvrJxmKhTKbDw_h_kH98kBwKSY/edit?usp=sharing).  Simply use the correct corresponding answer at each step, and you should be golden.  Unusual Patronuses are marked in green, and Very Rare Patronuses are marked in yellow.  For those categories, the first five steps are available on the first sheet with the additional questions on their respective sheets.

Just to serve as one more caution, for those seeking gendered animals and some of the uncommon ones, since they share combinations with another Patronus, I cannot guarantee you will get that one on your first try.  However, as I personally confirmed every single Patronus, I can guarantee the combination does work.  It might just take a few tries.  It's also indicated which ones share combinations with another animal so that you know it was no mistake on your part.

I hope you all enjoy my findings!

##Is a Quiz with Every Question Possible?
Finally, now that the quiz has been cracked, the question turns to whether we can create a full version with all questions.  I would say the answer is both yes and no.  Unfortunately, since the quiz relies on corresponding answers, we couldn't just throw all the questions in since people would undoubtedly give conflicting answers per question set.

However, after spending more time on this quiz than I ever thought possible, I'm currently drafting up a version that should utilize all of the questions, largely maintain how the quiz operates, and actually pinpoint your Patronus.  Stay tuned for more information.  Similarly, if there are individuals with experience with programming/coding quizzes who would like to help/has ideas, feel free to PM me.

##Acknowledgements
Finally, this post would not be complete without an Acknowledgements section since I would have never been able to do this on my own.  First, I would like to thank everyone who provided me with information.  Without that wealth of information, this would have taken a lifetime.  In addition, I would like to especially thank the following people:

* /u/Rocket_Sciencetist for helping collect the initial wave of data
* /u/ibid-11962 for initially compiling the list of questions as well as providing all of the Patronus video links
* /u/N1ffler for verifying the list of Patronuses using Pottermore's internal numbering system
* /u/LogicalRuse for figuring out how the quiz operated
* /u/Darth_Pyre for providing me the missing piece to crack the entire quiz
* The [Bassett Hound Patronus](https://patronus.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/fallback/videos/animals/BassettHound.mp4) for being the first Patronus I fully mapped out (despite not even being mine!) because, without that, none of this would have been possible...

Hope this information helps you all!

Sincerely,

Alolakazam

What Would Harry's True Patronus Be?,"The books establish that your patronus can change to match someone you love. This happened two times, in the case of Tonks, and in the case of Harry. Harry's patronus is a stag, just like his dads. Because there are several differences between Harry and James on a personal level, we can assume that Harry's patronus wouldn't actually have been a stag if it hadn't changed to match James. What do you guys think that Harry's ""true"" patronus be, I think that it would probably be a cat.

Rare patronuses and the link to Fantastic Beasts!,"Has anyone here got an occamy or erumpent patronus? It occured to me whilst reading the possible patronus outcomes that some of the magical beasts had previously been confirmed as appearing in Fantastic Beasts.

The Erumpent and Occamy are already confirmed as being in the film (the Erumpent was confirmed by mugglenet during their set visit, and the Occamy is briefly seen in the trailer). What do you all think about hidden clues appearing the patronus quiz? Also, what patronus do you think Newt would have?

I've reread this book numerous times, but for some reason I missed this little throwback to the end of *Sorceror's Stone* when they're trying to defeat the Devil's Snare and Hermione is panicking because ""there's no wood!"" and Ron yells, ""HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?"" Even when reading Book 1 as a kid, the absurdity of that exchange made me LOL. 

But this was just a fun, rich throwback for a number of reasons. Of course, ""wingardium leviosa"" is one of the first interactions between Ron and Hermione. On top of that, the idea of Ron looking for Crookshanks is comical given his hatred for him in *Prisoner of Azkaban.*
 
Unlike a lot of fandom, I actually believe that Ron and Hermione 100% absolutely belong together. The two are eachother's complements, and they give eachother what they need. This scene is particularly poignant, because Hermione shows that she believes in Ron's magical abilities.

"Okay, so I still have my sealed preorder of Deathly Hallows from 2007.","https://imgur.com/j2W38Hg

Okay, so 9 (10? Whenever preorders went live) years ago, I preordered Deathly Hallows in Amazon. It was shipped and was scheduled to be delivered on July 21, 2007. July 21st came and I get a notification from UPS that they lost the package. I freaked out of course. So I had my boyfriend drive me to the closest Barnes and Nobles and was lucky enough to snag a copy of the book. And I wrote off the amazon preordered book to be lost in limbo somewhere. Well, a few days later I found it waiting on my doorstop, still perfectly sealed. I didn't open it since I already finished the book at that point. And now it's 2016 and here it is, still sealed.

Edit: Apparently, I confused some people cause my wording was wrong. The package was delivered a few days after July 21, 2007 still sealed and it's still sealed to this day in 2016. :P My bad. 

Edit: Thank you guys! I'm very surprised that it got this much attention. The discussions about how valuable the book might be, and Schrodinger's paradox (the book does &amp; doesn't exist, is and isn't an HP book all at the same time)!

Book 4 is a poorly-constructed mess,"**WARNING: This post contains major spoilers for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.**

Firstly, I apologize if this has already been discussed here. I‚Äôve had this conversation with many friends, and it‚Äôs bugged me that so few of them see my point. I also want to stress that *I really do enjoy GoF.* I think it‚Äôs atmospherically fantastic and a great change in the tone of the series. It succeeds in opening up the wizarding world beyond the UK and performs a central role in the overarching plot. All of that said, I also believe that of all the books in the series, it has the worst overall construction, resulting in a messy, overly-complex story.

The crux of my argument is that the fundamental plot of GoF is inherently flawed: that Voldemort would manipulate the Triwizard Tournament in a way that would result in Harry ending up at the Riddle House. The main problem here is obvious. *Why would Voldemort need Harry to compete in (and win) the Triwizard Tournament in order to get him to touch a portkey?* There are so many simpler ways of accomplishing this goal. I believe this plot was created so that JK Rowling could have her cake and eat it too ‚Äì so that‚Ä¶

* We could engage in a whodunit re: Harry‚Äôs name in the Goblet of Fire
* We could have an unexpected twist.
* Harry could win something big.
* Voldemort could return.

The rest of the book is basically a smokescreen for the fact that all of these plot points don‚Äôt *need* to happen (Voldemort returning is the only one necessary for the continuation of the series). So let‚Äôs start with the first point from above, the whodunit. Here‚Äôs a list of all the new characters introduced in GoF:

Amos Diggory, Barty Crouch, Ludo Bagman, Winky, Victor Krum, Mad-Eye Moody, Igor Karkaroff, Olympe Maxime, Fleur Delacour, Bellatrix Lestrange, Barty Crouch Jr.

My apologies if any were missed, but that helps to prove my point. Of all these characters, *maybe* two of them are at all important to the rest of the series (Moody &amp; Bellatrix). Four of them (Krum, Fleur, Karkaroff, &amp; Maxime) are incidental minor characters, and the other five (Diggory, Crouch, Bagman, Winky, &amp; Crouch Jr.) are almost *never* mentioned ever again (unless you count CC as canon). My point here is that GoF has *nine characters* introduced solely as plot devices. Ideally, these characters would all serve the role of possible saboteur, but in practice, we wind up with a handful of characters who nobody cares about and accomplish nothing. I also want to specifically call out Winky for being the most useless character of all time. Like, it‚Äôs so obvious she‚Äôs a plot device to call our attention to Crouch that I‚Äôm just annoyed whenever she‚Äôs in a scene.

Next, the twist in GoF is such a huge disappointment after the masterful twist in PoA. Scabbers was a minor character important enough to get our attention, but Moody is a *major* character who also plays an important role in later books. So instead of the shock and awe we felt from the Pettigrew twist, we feel cheated out of knowing a central character who we really liked and have to ‚Äúmeet‚Äù all over again. Beyond that, *there is no possible way the twist in GoF could have been predicted.* I don‚Äôt mean this in the ‚Äúgreat job, JKR‚Äù way; I mean that a twist like the one in GoF is cheating readers in that it plays outside the rules of the story. There was nowhere near enough evidence to suggest that Barty Crouch Jr. was alive, a death eater, and at Hogwarts. In order to figure that out, you would have to a) assume a knowledge of how the Marauders‚Äô Map works beyond what we knew at that point to be true, b) question the validity of Sirius‚Äôs claims re: seeing the dead body in Azkaban, and c) make an assumption about Crouch Jr.‚Äôs allegiance based on little-to-no evidence. I can see one, or even two, of these things happening, but all three? That‚Äôs just not how good plot twists function.

The final point is simple: JKR needing Harry to win the Triwizard Tournament is just plain lazy. I guess part of the charm of the early books in the series is that sense of competition offered by Quidditch/the House Cup, but GoF is a more mature, darker book than its predecessors. There‚Äôs really no reason Harry needs to (or *should*) win the tournament. It compounds the primary issue here, which is that *Harry doesn‚Äôt need to be in the tournament at all.*

So, that was a rant. I‚Äôd love to hear any opinions/disagreements/etc., especially since I know a lot of people really love GoF. Thanks for reading!

"Most Animagi would turn into an animal different from that of their Patronus, right?","After reading the Pottermore information on the Patronus charm, I've been thoroughly disappointed that your Patronus has nothing to do with your favorite animal. As my username suggests, I'm obsessed with hourglass dolphins, and I was really sad when I didn't get one in the quiz. It made me realize something - while your Patronus is a beast which serves as an outside force, protecting you from despair, the animal you'd become as an Animagus is more of who you are, or the creature you relate to the most. There's a reason the word ""Patronus"" is Latin for godfather - it's like a friend, or helper. It doesn't define who you are.

Maybe I'm way off-base here.

------------------

**Total:** 558 (currently) -&gt; counting around 985 responses as of 7:00 PM EST -&gt; total of 993 counted by 9:00 PM EST 

-------------------

**Age Range:** 765 responses

- (13 - 17) - 9%

- (18 - 24) - 45%

- (25 - 34) - 42%

- (35 - 44) - 3%

- (45 - 54) - &lt;1%

Overall, *Harry Potter* fans online - on Reddit, MuggleNet, Twitter, Tumblr, and other online social media websites - are overwhelmingly **millennial**, or born from 1980 to 1995. The oldest of these would be 35-36 years old now, and the youngest being 21 years old.

The rest of the demographics seem to be made up of the upcoming Generation Z, those born from 1996 to 2011. The main cutoff for the 18 - 24 demographic in this survey, for the youngest qualifiers, is being born in 1998.

------------

**Gender:** 881 responses

- Male - 27% -&gt; 31% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Female - 71% - &gt; 66% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Non-binary / Genderfluid / Other - 3%

The Harry Potter fanbase, at least online, is not only overwhelmingly milennial - but also overwhelmingly female.

Based on other surveys, the higher percentage of female responses may be due to me sharing this on other websites besides Reddit. (MuggleNet, Twitter, and Tumblr)

Reddit, as previous surveys have shown, tends to, as a whole, lean more towards a male audience and demographic.

Compare:

- /u/littleotterpop - [survey from 1 month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4ynuc8/results_from_the_survey_on_hogwarts_house_and/) - 58.25% female

- /u/sclvt - [survey from 3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4ncsvw/a_few_days_ago_i_posted_a_survey_on_this/) - 53% female

-----------

**Hogwarts house:** 985 responses

- Gryffindor - 19%

- Hufflepuff - 25% -&gt; 22% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Ravenclaw - 30% -&gt; 32% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Slytherin - 27% -&gt; 26% *(after posting to Reddit)*

The largest percentage of respondants were Ravenclaw. This is also in-line with the findings of /u/sclvt, [whose survey showed](https://www.allcounted.com/share?view=summary&amp;cid=oc495hyxbzduc) that around 39-40% of respondants heavily preferred Ravenclaw as their House.

--------------

**Ilvermorny house:** 879 responses

- Thunderbird - 40% -&gt; 38% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Wampus - 12% 

- Pukwudgie - 25% -&gt; 24% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Horned Serpent - 23% -&gt; 25% *(after posting to Reddit)*

Out of all of the responses, Thunderbird was the clearly dominant house in terms of Ilvermorny sortings. Surprisingly, Pukwudgie was next, with 25%, beating out Horned Serpent, with 23%.

Wampus was by far the rarest of the Houses, with 12%.

---------------

**Patronuses:** 558 responses -&gt; 993 responses *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Bird (any species): ~16% -&gt; ~23.3% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Felines (cats, lions, tigers, lynxes, etc.): ~17% -&gt; ~16.4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Canids (dogs, foxes, wolves): ~15% -&gt; ~13.7% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Mythical Creatures: ~11% -&gt; ~9% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Horse (any color) - ~9% -&gt; ~7.3% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Aquatic Animal (dolphin, orca, salmon, shark, seal): ~10% -&gt; ~5.6% *(after posting to Reddit)*

**Most Common Patronuses:**

- Birds: Eagle (8.1% of birds), Magpie (5.6%), Falcon (5.1%), Raven (5.1%), White Swan (4.7%)

- Felines: Domesticated cats made up ~13.5% of the total alone (~82.8 of felines), with Nebelung being the most popular (14.8% of dom. cats), Manx second (11.8%); 

- Canids: Domesticated dogs made up ~8% of the total alone (~79.5% of canids), with Deerhounds being the most common (14.6% of dom. dogs, ~11.6% of canids); foxes made up the ~11.6% of canids, with wolves making up ~8.7% of canids

- Mythical Creatures: Thestrals were the most common (~27.7% of mythical creatures), followed by Dragons (~18.8%) and Hippogriffs (~12.2%)

- Horses: Most common were White Stallions and Mares (~28.7% of horse Patronuses)

- Aquatic Animal: Dolphins by far made up the most of this catagory, making up ~4.3% of the total alone; they made up ~76.7% of aqautic animal Patronuses

Domesticated cats far outnumbered big cats, as did domesticated dogs with their wild cousins (wolves and foxes).

7 Dun Mares were reported, but no Dun Stallions.

**Most Uncommon (Rarest) Patronuses**

- Birds: Browl Owl, Little Owl, Vulture, Peacock

- Felines: Lion, Lioness, Leopard, Cheetah

- Canids: Of domesticated dogs, any type of Terrier

- Mythical Creatures: Erumpent, Occamy, Abraxan Winged Horse

- Aquatic Animal: Seal, Salmon, Shark, Orca

- Overall: Capuchin Monkey, Dun Stallion, Impala, Python, Lion, Erumpent, Stag / Doe

Most of the recorded badgers and dolphins belonged to Hufflepuffs, whereas cats and birds-of-prey were more likely to belong to a Ravenclaw or a Slytherin. Slytherins also had more ""exotic"" Patronuses than Ravenclaws did.

----------

**Desired Patronuses:** *Unable to access due to response cutoff.*

**Wand wood:** 854 responses

The top wand woods were:

- Ebony - 5%

- Sycamore - 5% -&gt; 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Elm - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Maple - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Black Walnut - 4%

- Ash - 4%

- Hazel - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Hawthorn - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Redwood - 4%

This was in-line with [another wand survey I did](http://acagoldsmith.tumblr.com/post/127337806331/pottermore-wands-hogwarts-houses-masterpost) about a year ago, with one notable exception: Redwood seems to be much more popular, perhapd due to changes to the Pottermore wand quiz.

Other wand woods that were much more popular included Hawthorn (2% gain), Pine (2% gain), Cypress (2% gain), and Elm (1% gain). 

This also may be due to more ""balanced"" reporting this time, as that survey linked above had 40% of the respondants report Slytherin as their house. 

In my previous survey, Hawthorn and Pine in particular preferred Ravenclaws, and the increased amount of Ravenclaw participation indicates the probable reason for these gains.

More Gryffindors (22%) also reported in for that survey, compared to 19% for this survey. Yet Redwood woods, shown to prefer Gryffindors in my previous survey, increased in number.

---------------

**Wand Cores:** 850 responses

- Unicorn hair - 40% -&gt; 38% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Phoenix feather - 35% -&gt; 37% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Dragon heartstring - 26%

These results are in clear contrast with Pottermore writings. While Pottermore claims phoenix feather to be ""the rarest wand core of them all"", this survey shows that this is not the case. 

In fact, dragon heartstring proved to be much rarer than phoenix feather in this survey.

As to why? My previous survey showed a direct connection, and correlation, to dragon heartstring-core wands overwhelmingly choosing Slytherins.

Because of the much lower rate of Slytherins participating in this particular survey, the number of dragon heartstring-core wands also went down significantly. 

In return, the number of unicorn hair-core wands shot up significantly, most likely due to increased participation by Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws.

**Suggestions to Improve the Patronus Quiz**

There were many suggestions to improve the Pottermore Patronus Quiz, with the #1 being:

&gt; ""I did not feel that the test was in-depth enough; did not give me an option to retake it; and/or gave me a Patronus that I couldn't identify with.""

Other complaints:

- ""The quiz was too laggy / froze / did not work correctly.""

- ""The quiz should have given all questions in one go.""

- ""The quiz was too random / abstract / unpredictable.""

- ""The quiz gave no description on the animal I got for a Patronus.""

Domesticated cats far outnumbered big cats, as did domesticated dogs with their wild cousins (wolves and foxes).

7 Dun Mares were reported, but no Dun Stallions.

**Most Uncommon (Rarest) Patronuses**

- Birds: Browl Owl, Little Owl, Vulture, Peacock

- Felines: Lion, Lioness, Leopard, Cheetah

- Canids: Of domesticated dogs, any type of Terrier

- Mythical Creatures: Erumpent, Occamy, Abraxan Winged Horse

- Aquatic Animal: Seal, Salmon, Shark, Orca

- Overall: Capuchin Monkey, Dun Stallion, Impala, Python, Lion, Erumpent, Stag / Doe

Most of the recorded badgers and dolphins belonged to Hufflepuffs, whereas cats and birds-of-prey were more likely to belong to a Ravenclaw or a Slytherin. Slytherins also had more ""exotic"" Patronuses than Ravenclaws did.

**Wand wood:** 854 responses

The top wand woods were:

- Ebony - 5%

- Sycamore - 5% -&gt; 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Elm - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Maple - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Black Walnut - 4%

- Ash - 4%

- Hazel - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Hawthorn - 4% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Redwood - 4%

This was in-line with [another wand survey I did](http://acagoldsmith.tumblr.com/post/127337806331/pottermore-wands-hogwarts-houses-masterpost) about a year ago, with one notable exception: Redwood seems to be much more popular, perhapd due to changes to the Pottermore wand quiz.

Other wand woods that were much more popular included Hawthorn (2% gain), Pine (2% gain), Cypress (2% gain), and Elm (1% gain). 

This also may be due to more ""balanced"" reporting this time, as that survey linked above had 40% of the respondants report Slytherin as their house. 

In my previous survey, Hawthorn and Pine in particular preferred Ravenclaws, and the increased amount of Ravenclaw participation indicates the probable reason for these gains.

More Gryffindors (22%) also reported in for that survey, compared to 19% for this survey. Yet Redwood woods, shown to prefer Gryffindors in my previous survey, increased in number.

**Wand Cores:** 850 responses

- Unicorn hair - 40% -&gt; 38% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Phoenix feather - 35% -&gt; 37% *(after posting to Reddit)*

- Dragon heartstring - 26%

These results are in clear contrast with Pottermore writings. While Pottermore claims phoenix feather to be ""the rarest wand core of them all"", this survey shows that this is not the case. 

In fact, dragon heartstring proved to be much rarer than phoenix feather in this survey.

As to why? My previous survey showed a direct connection, and correlation, to dragon heartstring-core wands overwhelmingly choosing Slytherins.

Because of the much lower rate of Slytherins participating in this particular survey, the number of dragon heartstring-core wands also went down significantly. 

In return, the number of unicorn hair-core wands shot up significantly, most likely due to increased participation by Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws.

**Suggestions to Improve the Patronus Quiz**

There were many suggestions to improve the Pottermore Patronus Quiz, with the #1 being:

&gt; ""I did not feel that the test was in-depth enough; did not give me an option to retake it; and/or gave me a Patronus that I couldn't identify with.""

Other complaints:

- ""The quiz was too laggy / froze / did not work correctly.""

- ""The quiz should have given all questions in one go.""

- ""The quiz was too random / abstract / unpredictable.""

- ""The quiz gave no description on the animal I got for a Patronus.""

As the survey creator, I would like to give a huge thank-you to everyone who participated in this survey!"
Is there a compendium of sorts with pictures/videos of all of the Patronuses so far?,"See title. I'd love to see if there is already a good place to go to find pics of all of the patronuses from Pottermore... if not, maybe we could make our own?
